More documentation to come.\n\n.. note::Multi-threading seems to work fine for Cholesky decomposition, but it fails for the solve phase in which -j1 is the fastest, here we specify thread numbers independently using :yref:`FlowEngine::numFactorizeThreads` and :yref:`FlowEngine::numSolveThreads`. These multhreading settings are only impacting the behaviour of openblas library and are relatively independant of :yref:`FlowEngine::multithread`. However, the settings have to be globally consistent. For instance, :yref:`multithread<FlowEngine::multithread>` =True with  yref:`numFactorizeThreads<FlowEngine::numFactorizeThreads>` = yref:`numSolveThreads<FlowEngine::numSolveThreads>` = 4 implies that openblas will mobilize 8 processors at some point. If the system does not have so many procs. it will hurt performance.",
