/*! @brief QMGeometry contains geometrical information used to display the particle on screen.

 * Quantum particles have no geometry in classical sense. So in this class only has
 * stuff needed to configure the display of the wavefunction in QMState.
 *
 * Things like color, or if it's a wireframe to display, etc.
 *
 * No physical/calculations related stuff here! Only display.
