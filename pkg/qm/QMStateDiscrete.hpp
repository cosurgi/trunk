/*! @brief QMStateDiscrete contains state information about each particle.
 *
 * The information is expressed using discrete numerical representations. Most likely an N-dimensional gird.
 * A spatial position representation is used. On this grid the complex amplitude is stored, which defines
 * the probability distribution. Grid size usually is in powers of two, because that's most useful for FFT.
