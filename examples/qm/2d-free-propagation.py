## This is a simple test:
## - a freely moving particle according to Schrodinger equation is calculated using Tal-Ezer Kosloff 1984 method
## - it is compared with the same movement, but calculated analytically
## The error between numerical and analytical solution is plot on the graph

## Two particles are created - the analytical one, and the numerical one. They
## do not interact, they are two separate calculations in fact.

## The analytical one:

analyticBody = QMBody()
# make sure it will not interact with the other particle (although interaction is not possible/implemented anyway)
analyticBody.groupMask = 2
analyticBody.shape     = QMGeometry(extents=halfSize,color=[0.9,0.9,0.9],partsScale=40)
# it's too simple now. Later we will have quarks (up, down, etc.), leptons and bosons as a material.
# So no material for now.
analyticBody.material  = QMParticle(dim=dimensions,hbar=1,m=1)
gaussPacketArg         = {'x0':[0,0,0],'t0':0,'k0':[0.4,2,0],'a0':[3,2,0],'size':size,'gridSize':[128,64]}
analyticBody.state     = QMPacketGaussianWave(**gaussPacketArg)
nid=O.bodies.append(analyticBody)
O.bodies[nid].state.blockedDOFs='xyzXYZ' # is propagated as analytical solution - no calculations involved

## The numerical one:
numericalBody = QMBody()
# make sure it will not interact with the other particle (although interaction is not possible/implemented anyway)
numericalBody.groupMask = 1
numericalBody.shape     = QMGeometry(extents=halfSize,color=[1,1,1],partsScale=40)
numericalBody.material  = analyticBody.material
# Initialize the discrete wavefunction using the analytical gaussPacket created earlier.
# The wavefunction shape can be anything - as long as it is normalized, in this case the Gauss shape is used.
# The grid size must be a power of 2 to allow FFT. Here 2**12=4096 is used.
numericalBody.state     = QMPacketGaussianWave(**gaussPacketArg)
nid=O.bodies.append(numericalBody)
O.bodies[nid].state.blockedDOFs=''      # is being propagated by SchrodingerKosloffPropagator
