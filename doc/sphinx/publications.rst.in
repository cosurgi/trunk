Publications on Yade
=====================
This page should be a relatively complete list of publications on Yade itself or done with Yade. If you publish something, do not hesitate to add it on the list. If you don't have direct access to the source code, please send the reference (as a bibtex item) to the `editorial board <mailto:yadedemboard@gmail.com>`_. If PDF is freely available, add url for direct fulltext downlad. If not, consider uploading fulltext in PDF, either to `Yade wiki <https://www.yade-dem.org/wiki/>`_ or to other website, if legally permitted.

The first section gives the references that we kindly ask you to use for citing Yade in publications, as explained in the `"Acknowledging Yade" <citing.html>`_ section.
