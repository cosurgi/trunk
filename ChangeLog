      delete interactions immediatly after erasing body + revert change in InteractionContainer::erase (now useless)
      never re-use an erased iterator...
      faster implementation of interaction container's withBody() and withBodyAll()
      do not use ISCollider::targetInterv if =0

      add missing MPI_Comm declaration
      Subdomain::selfComm as a generic comm getter

      add reference data (from yadedaily 2018.02b-290bf6a54e~xenial) for new colliderCorrectness.py + make it a functionnal checkScript
      move checkColliderConstantness.py to skipped checks (because we don't want to freeze algorithms, we want correct results)
      why is mpi4py not in the docker image after https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/docker-yade/commit/644ffdad0feba9c625cb7ba7e741445ad8737c81 ?

      Revert "Remove Using multiple plots section from tutorial"
      Move the helper scripts to proper directory: scripts.
      Change path to ../examples/list_of_examples.txt from new place where scripts are located.

      Replace tabs by spaces in table, becasue they did not align correctly on gitlab's 'Changes' info.
      Update Hosting and versioning section in Programmer's manual.
      Since last 3SR build was on 1st February I think it is time to Fix issue #49. Build robot info now points to gitlab pipelines.
      Fix some typos in Regression tests section.
      fix few typos in Conventions
      Mention of GlobalEngines and PartialEngines links to inheritance graphs
      Explain in caption of inheritance graphs what are those gray dashed boxes, e.g. in GlobalEngine. Make those gray boxes to link to their respective inheritance graphs instead of classnames below.
      Fix typos and non-working snippets in user.rst

      I guess I have found the cause of the problem #55
      Fix issue #55
      Small fix in checkList.py: print the exception, count it as failure. Fixed #45, but checkPolyhedraCrush.py fails now.
      An older version of checkPolyhedraCrush.py passes tests with success! Fixed #45
      Change long VecBounds::size into size_t VecBounds::size();
      Remove obsolete assert( v.size()==v.vec.size() ); because it's the same thing.
      Remove size_t casts, which are no longer necessary.
      Make VecBounds::vec private, add necessary inline member functions, so that encapsulation of caching will be possible.
      Move all methods which will take part in ecapsuation of caching into single place
      Now it is possible to encapsulate caching, and that's what I did in this commit. We can toggle it on/off.
      Add some extra comments
      Enable VEC_BOUND_CACHING, so that I'll have a different yade version. This will simplyfy testing between 5f855ed80 and this one.
      cMake will correctly detect yade version when .git is a submodule.
      Attempt to fix multi-line comment warning when compiilng yade
      But this doesn't work, because of a bug in g++

      Debugging why yade -Lscipy.interpolate is not working, no success.
      Create nearly empty checkColliderCorrectness.py script.
      Small fixes in the dispatcher table generator
      First seemingly reasonable version of checkColliderCorrectness.py
      checkColliderCorrectness.py: prepare to save 'reference' results from Collider 2bc5ac90b before fixing #55. So this will be from the version of collider tested for many years.
      Add 'reference' results, from git revision 2bc5ac90b before fixing #55, from the version of collider tested for many years.
      The checks/checkColliderCorrectness.py is ready!
      Remove #define VEC_BOUND_CACHING and finish work on #55. Now Collider is a little bit better :)
      Caption under inheritance graph will have links to classes that wil be discussed in other sections.
      Add note about packages esys-particle and python-demgengeo
      Move childSet(…) upwards, because I'll need it soon.
      Links in caption of inheritance graphs point to inheritance graph if it exists, otherwise they point to the class descrition.
      Add separate sections to manual about dispatchers, functors and internal forces, so that they are not in 'Other classes' anymore. And can be linked from Programmer's manual
      Fix link from yade.wikia.com to yade-dem.org
      Replace http://bugs.launchpad.net/yade with https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/issues, if issue does not exist on gitlab then mention that it's a bugreport on previous launchpad site.

      More links to inheritance graphs.
      Fix some more links
      Remove obsolete info from tutorial. Other small improvements in documentation.
      Fix #56 mathjax does not support \multicolumn so I used \hspace{12mm} instead, and mathjax does not render to html \texttt inside \mbox, so I moved it outside \mbox.
      Add more links in tutorial-advanced.rst about creating videos
      Add a link to example tutorial videos online, that would work when clicked in .pdf file.
      Add a hint about reading documentation in the .pdf format.
      fix numerous links in .hpp files to documentation. Please remember to always use :yref:`ClassName::variable` or :ref:`section name <SectionNameAnchor>` and add an anchor in .rst file with .. _SectionNameAnchor
      A bit smaller picture size for TesselationWrapper
      Workaroud the bug in sphinx which cannot have clickable links in inheritance graphs in .pdf file, because sphinx cannot work with .ps files generated from graphviz. Instead I added the missing links into the figure caption.
      The extra links in caption to other classes is sorted now.
      Improve docstring for GlobalEngine & PartialEngine
      This diff will adapt number of jobs depending on the $CI_RUNNER_DESCRIPTION
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml, we can be more specific actually.
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml, and yade-runner-01 gets -j 1
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml. I've set concurrency=3 on 4pak. Let's see how long it is compiling with -j24
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml. OK, I think that 30cores is a reasonable maximum for concurrency=3. There is enough RAM. Just in some rare situations when 3 jobs run simultaneously on 64cores they will be slower, not a big deal.
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml. Added 6pak to yade runners. It's a little bit faster than 4pak. But can have only concurrency=1, because others use it too.
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml
      Looks like 6pak cannot handle -j 48. Not sure, I suspect problems with CPU temperature.
      Update .gitlab-ci.yml, fortunately yesterday's problem with 6pak was unrelated to gitlab-runner. We can use more cores.
      Merge branch 'adaptNumberOfJobs'
      Fix typos in FoamCoupling.rst, add :ysrc:`…` to example.
      Rename #ifdef YADE_FOAM → #ifdef YADE_MPI
      Fix some typos in documentation and examples. Fixed #60
      A little better titles of some chapters, propose a little different ordering.
      Add super-chapters in TOC to make the proposed logic clearly visible.
      Put CFD-DEM and FEM-DEM next to each other in physical-laws.rst
      Try different sectioning in TOC, maybe this will look better?
      Remove files which attempted to make super-chapter sectioning.
      Fix capitalization in section titles. Physical laws→Theoretical background, Miscellaneous→Performance enhancements
      FEMxDEM uses title more closer to original title, but a bit shorter.
      Restore previous tocdepth in .pdf after introducing new sections in .html
      Whoops, yade-runner is outdated. We must use 4pak, 6pak. I hope this will work!
      Revert prev.commit which added tag 'fast' everywhere. Instead I disable group runners fr now.
      Add extra anchor dem-background to not break older links.
      Add some rudimentary mathematical background in FEMxDEM description from [Guo2014]_.
      mathjax fix: \renewcommand{\mat}{\boldsymbol} - show matrix properly in FEMxDEM and other places.
      Try different TOC section names :)
      back to Performance enhancements?
      README.rst: Remove broken link to buildbot, add link to debian science team (salsa)
      fix broken link to beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/dresden2011/pres-3s.pdf, I uploaded newer (2011) presentation to our wiki, with updated class names.
      update .mailmap
      Remove execution bit from some *.cpp files.
      Add some extra explanations about rebasing and fixing the conflicts
      Add a bit more info in tutorial-introduction.rst
      Since ENABLE_PFVFLOW=ON by default I move the requisites into default apt-get install command, otherwise someone might have problems with compiling yade.
      Fix link to 'Getting help' section.
      apt install …… command tested on: 16.04, 18.04, 18.10, debian9, debian10. Assume that new users will install on 18.04, 18.10 or a new debian. So the 'extra' instructions are now for older 16.04 ← the inverse of what was before this commit.
      Add locales-all to 'make doc' dependencies otherwise 18.04, 18.10, debian10 can produce error: 'Building format(s) --all. …… fmtutil failed.'
      mathjax does not understand :math:`\textgreater`
      Small fixes and comment, link to cgal, put → instead of ->
      Again fix link to 'Getting help' section. Remove link to wiki/Contact, also I changed the link on wiki front page and added redirect in the wiki Contact page.
      Fix rebase conflict in .gitlab-ci.yml
      Fix rebase conflict in CMakeLists.txt
      README.rst: put 'good' readme on top, 'python-3 status' below. This will make it easier to merge later.
      Start fixing conflicts in installation.rst. I need to pull in 7 chroots for testing, so I push this now.
      [python3] apt install …… command tested on: 16.04, 18.04, 18.10, debian9, debian10. [python2] apt install not tested here, but was tested recently in 4d61e363b
      Add some note about python2→3 script migration.
      Add first column in examples/list_of_examples.txt to mark if example works with python3
      Fix "Jun" in references.bib, #pragma GCC diagnostic pop - to find bugs early we need all the warnings!
      Make base classes clickable by fixing makeBaseClassesClickable(…); Use dpi=300; for .pdf to fix pixelated/unreadable inheritance diagrams.
      print what scripts have failed.
      Try vim command ':retab' in an attempt to fix indentation in scripts.
      quick-fix until 7pak gets added to this file: set default JOBSNUM=40
      Temporarily add checkDEM-PFVPressureInjection.py to ignored scripts.
      Turns out that dpi=400 does not work on ubuntu 18.04. But works in all 6 other chroots! While clikable base classes work only on stretch
      [python3] Fix issue #70 - turns out it was python3 migration problem after all
      makeBaseClassesClickable(…); works on 16.04, 18.04, 18.10, debian9, debian10
      Small cleanup, remove dpi_fix.
      [python] checked 182 examples, had to fix 10 of them.
      [python3] fix vtk export.py and deformableelementsutils.py
      [python3] small update in script used for testing examples. Still 4 examples are not working in python3.
      small update in examples/list_of_examples.txt
      small note in list_of_examples.txt
      [python3 and python2] apt install …… command tested on: 16.04, 18.04, 18.10, debian9, debian10.
      Now README.rst is ready for merging. Everything works in python2 (excluding make doc) & python3 (excluding 4 examples).
      [Python3] Fix mpi openafoam examples.
      Fix OpenGLRenderer crash which happened when body was deleted at the same time when the interaction was being drawn.
      Fixed #48. Also added a note which should help in debugging requestErase(I);
      Add barebones for yade.libVersions module. This commit may later be useful for tutorial about adding yade modules.
      The .hpp file isn't necessary in this simple case, after all.
      Library version detection starts to work.
      Added compiler version detection and boost version detection.
      printAllVersions() starts to work with nicely formatted table
      Add some comments
      core/main/main.py.in: from yade.libVersions import printAllVersions
      Small fixes.
      Fix rst formatting printed by printAllVersions(True)
      Some small fixes in comments.
      yade --test ; --check now writes messages in colors.
      Add utilsModule to py/tests/__init__.py allTests[…]. It was never tested before!
      Add detailed info in documentation about how to add ne yade --tests
      Add libVersions to 'yade --test'
      Add detection of versions for qt, freeglut, gl, qglviewer, python
      Check what pipeline says about versions for python2.
      Improve qt and python detection.
      Add detection of eigen, sqlite, suitesparse.
      (switch pipeline to python3) Revert "Check what pipeline says about versions for python2."
      Added detection of openblas, metis. Now C++ detects all lib versions.
      Added versions detected by cmake.
      Small fix in eigen and mpi. Detection is good in C++, in cmake part it can be improved in some cases.
      Let cmake find #include path for openblas.
      Small fix with ${BLAS_INCLUDE_DIR}
      yade --test verifies that library versions from cmake and C++ agree with each other.
      yade.libVersions has complete documentation in docstrings.
      Fix issue #45, add warning to PolyhedraSplitter::action() and documentation about cgal versions.
      Few more small improvements. Add exception for cmake mpi detection because I don't know how to get correctly mpi version from cmake.
      Add extra note about problems with detecting mpi version by cmake.
      small fix
      Add a note about #include for openblas_config.h
      Rename allVersionsCmake() → getAllVersionsCmake(); allVersionsCpp() → getAllVersionsCpp(); for consitency with naming conventions.
      fix typo
      Use more cores.
      Add tags: fast for build. So that compilation will only use fast gitlab-runners.
      Try if yade-runner can handle -DCHUNKSIZE=4 to speed up compilation from 13m30sec to …?
      Use -DCHUNKSIZE=1 for master and -DCHUNKSIZE=4 for merge_request to make compilation faster by 3 minutes.
      Mention Gdańsk in 'Building, regression tests'
      Add 7pak to runners, make case statement to be multiline.
      Add stage for 'only: branches' so that pipeline will recompile outside a merge request (we can afford this now). Add extra comments.
      Add 'tags: workingrunner' so that 'brokenrunner' not activated. So you can test yade-runner-01 by replacing 'brokenrunner' with 'workingrunner' or putting 'tags: brokenrunner' in cmake stage
      Hm, I could not separate merge_request from branches.
      Remove 'only: branches' to avoid triggering two pipelines on each push.
      Fix issue #64
      Enable by default OpenFOAM & potential particles, as suggested in https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/docker-yade/merge_requests/4#note_165851503 and https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/issues/64#note_156328333
      Remove tags: workingrunner, it's too many tags, see https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/merge_requests/100#note_165850147
      Use separate names for cmake stages on master and merge request.
      [python3 and python2] [PotentialBlocks update] apt install …… command tested on: 16.04, 18.04, 18.10, debian9, debian10.
      printAllVersions(…) will sort alphabetically before printing.
      Fix issue #73, ccache now works on 16.04, 18.04, 18.10, debian9, debian10
      Add extra comment.
      Remove note from installation.rst about problems with ccache.
      Start fixing #63, maybe needs more investigation. Or maybe removing these INCLUDEs is just enough.
      Rearrange and add INCLUDE(GetVersion)
      rebase on !111
      merge_request: use 2 minutes faster linker; master: use regular linker.
      Add 'onlyOneScript = []' for easier debugging of scripts.
      checkList.py prints to stderr.
      trigger this bug in the pipeline.
      Revert "trigger this bug in the pipeline."
      Use ccache directory mounted from the host of the gitlab runner.
      Small fix.
      test ubuntu 16.04
      ccache is so fast that gitlab-runners build on four linux distros: ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, debian 9 stretch, debian 10 buster.
      set expiration date on artifacts, save on storage.
      Add cat /etc/issue after test.
      master also uses ccache. Increase JOBSNUM a bit.
      To make pipelines faster put doc generation into test stage.
      Since everything is ccached now, I can increase JOBSNUM a bit more.
      Bring back previous concurrency setting and high -j.
      Do full four distro checks only on master.
      Remove -DCHUNKSIZE=1
      (Fix #75) check*PressureInjection.py no longer leave some files after running.
      Fix warning: warning ‘volPart’ may be used uninitialized in this function
      Ah, no reason to throw myself, when I can use .value() to throw for me.
      Remove unnecessary import in dummyTest.py
      Add testColliderByGiulia.py to yade --test
      Note important when writing more docs: test scripts must be fully initialized in setUp(self)
      Remove unnecessary comments, add skip_4200_iterations=True so that this test is faster (and tests the same thing).
      Add bordercase test for a little different cellsize it must be OK.
      Small cleanup, keep only 'from yade.utils import *'
      Not sure what happened to deploy stage in master. Maybe renaming 'pages' stage will bring it back.
      Fix some warnings
      Introduce YadeCheckError Exception, make sure it works properly, I tested this on checkColliderCorrectness.py
      Use raise YadeCheckError(message) instead of resultStatus+=1; --checks are simpler to write now.
      Update documentation about simpler writing of yade --checks
      Remove printing output to stderr output.
      Small fix.
      Make Injection simpler: remove errors,errMsg; keep only YadeCheckError
      printAllVersions(): print yade config dir relative to ${HOME}
      Print linux version.
      Improve gitlab formatting used for pasting.
      Detect numpy version.
      Detect numpy and ipython versions.
      Better linux version formatting.
      Improve linux version detection.
      small fix
      Improve docstring for getLinuxVersion()
      Try cmake stage using first version of opensuse15 image.
      Try searching /usr/lib64/libboost_python-py3.so.1.66.0
      remove libboost python hack
      remove symlink
      Add more paths to find QGLViewer
      Enable more stages in .gitlab-ci.yml
      Quick install binutils-gold, later this should go to docker image
      Fix issue #77 and fix #39. ‘updateGL’ not declared
      Fix compatibility vtk7↔vtk8 name change of InsertNextTupleValue → InsertNextTuple; Remove mess introduced by prefious #ifdef YADE_VTK8
      Revert "Quick install binutils-gold, later this should go to docker image" This reverts commit 6f9fdd9120615cac3b9239ddb27c2f7365e41db8.
      fix vtk7↔vtk8: InsertNextTypedTuple↔InsertNextTupleValue
      Check if opensuse15 fixes work on all 5 distros.
      Go back to default testing on ubuntu 18.04
      opensuse: cat /etc/issue → cat /etc/*elease (show release version properly)
      Use shorter name suse15, so that pipeline view on gitlab looks good.
      Start writing a template in .gitlab-ci.yml
      Test cmake template.
      Use templates for all stages
      Small fix
      Compile on all 5 distros, to verify.
      Move only: master & merge_request to a template too!
      Disable compiling ALL on merge_request. MR uses now only ubuntu 18.04
      Small fix: the section 'only:' overwrites the template, not adds to it.
      [libVersions] detect sphinx doc version, update links to some libraries: numpy, ipython, gcc, suitesparse
      add citation
      Small fix in docstring
      Update yade link to debian package tracking system
      'Speed-up compilation': add section about 2minutes faster linking.

      Add note about printAllVersions()
      Small note
      Make this commit history a bit shorter with 'git pull --rebase upstream master' & 'git rebase -i master' & 'fixup' during rebase & git rerere
      Fine grained detection of MPI & metis libs. Re: https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/680867 , https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/681091
      small fix
      Make sure that #include <mpi.h> will work.
      Rename gitlab-runners so that they don't have _ or - in their name.
      Add link to optional prerequisite python3-mpi4py
      libVersions detect mpi4py version.
      Restore .gitlab-ci.yml from master except (1) new gitlab-runner names (2) keep a commented out command for oversubscribe etc. (3) still check MR on all distros.
      Enable checkColliderConstantness.py with new test data (interesting: changes are around 3rd decimal place.)
      In this commit I compared mpiArcheologists+rebase master+mpi-master-merge with current mpi-master-merge. And they were the same, except those few whitespaces+typo which I cleanup in this commit. This is good.
      Move files before they were deleted.

      Fix broken link to article about fixing git conflicts.
      Add links to COIN-OR Linear Programming Solver
      Set ENABLE_FEMLIKE=ON by default.
      Fix usage of CREATE_LOGGER macros. In some places the macro 'degraded' and produced some compilation errors.
      Add missing CREATE_LOGGER; Add macro CREATE_LOCAL_LOGGER(fileName.cpp); when logging filters are needed outside classes.
      CREATE_LOCAL_LOGGER should use the "filename.cpp"
      Rename to CREATE_CPP_LOCAL_LOGGER("filename.cpp"); Add a bunch of missing CREATE_LOGGER(ClassName);
      small cleanup

      Set table column widths to reasonable size: no test breaks in the column.
      Add MAX_LOG_LEVEL to CMakeLists.txt
      Use MAX_LOG_LEVEL to disable selected macros: for production builds it is faster to skip integer comparison for filters.
      first version of log.setLevel(…) which actually does something.
      Write in documentation about log.setLevel(NewtonIntegrator,log.TRACE) and MAX_LOG_LEVEL
      Small fix in CMakeLists.txt, use MAX_LOG_LEVEL properly.

      Simpler function testAllLevels()
      Use default MAX_LOG_LEVEL=5, so that users who install yade from .deb package can provide us with LOG_DEBUG info when necessary.
      Add yade.log.getMaxLevel()
      Small fixes in docs
      Again small fixes in docs
      Add commented out section about measuring performance effect of MAX_LOG_LEVEL. When macros are more widely used it will be possible to measure the effect. Right now it is impossible to measure
      Remove the (empty) performance table for now. I might become useful later.
      Add some comments.
      Update comments & docs in places where recommended is MAX_LOG_LEVEL<=5 for production builds
      Small improvements in documentation.
      Some final touches in the yade.log documentation
      Fix https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/issues/102
      Add debian bullseye to build+test+check gitlab ci pipeline.
      Add compiler flag -Wextra so that compiler will print extra warnings.
      Fix 'unused parameter' and 'ignored "const" qualifier' and few other warnings.
      Use newer C++ standard from year 2014, to use new language features and possibly better compiler optimizations (latest available is 2017, would be great to use this one).
      Note in comments what would be the best target flags to find all warnings
      Add -Wshadow=compatible-local -Werror=narrowing -Werror=return-type -Werror=uninitialized -Wno-error=maybe-uninitialized (warn about shadowing (but only compatibile types), mark some warnings as errors)
      Fix some of -Wshadow=compatible-local warnings. (plenty)
      Fix some more of -Wshadow=compatible-local warnings.
      Fix all -Wshadow=compatible-local warnings.
      Since every possible warning is fixed, turn them all into errors. Except those impossible to fix: eigen (multi line comment, maybe uninitilized), OMPI (cast between incompatible function types). They will remain as warnings.
      Update target flags, to reflect that some are now marked as errors.
      Script list_of_examples_make_videos.sh will now go through only working examples - quicker to launch it and test all examples if they still work.
      Add small note in gravityBis.py (checked all examples)
      Use -Werror to turn all warnings into errors. (shorter version, same meaning)
      Tailor available warnings to what a given compiler version can offer.
      small fix
      Fix -Wempty-body warnings.
      Fix unused-variable warnings when LOG_* macros are not used and variable is not printed (not used at all).
      fix typo
      Add ENABLE_USEFUL_ERRORS=ON. Using =OFF will result in using flags from before this work: without -Wextra, -Wshadow and more. This is for people who try to compile yade on untested/unsupported linux distributions.
      Fix -Werror compatible-local for ubuntu 18.10 which has a combination of eigen 3.3.4 and g++ 8.2.
      small fix
      Use previous fix also for ubuntu 18.04
      numpy 1.11.0 has unused-function, 1.13 does not. So we have to print warning when it appears.
      Detect earlier numpy version.
      Improve comments
      Don't overwrite data/checkColliderCorrect.txt on each yade --check (small mistake, git diff would have spotted this anyway in case of problems)
      Rename github.rst→gitlab.rst; ln -s gitlab.rst github.rst ← create symlink to not break all old references.
      Change in *.rst file from github.rst → gitlab.rst
      Rename rst label: _yade-github-label → _yade-gitlab-label
      Rename gitlab.rst → gitrepo.rst
      Change in *.rst file from gitlab.rst → gitrepo.rst
      Rename rst label: _yade-gitlab-label → _yade-gitrepo-label
      Compile and yade --test without OpenGL.
      Use image yade:ubuntu18.04_nogui for this test
      Fix #108
      Add extra warning in the comments, to avoid such mistake in the future.
      Add :ysrccommit: to link specific commit from gitlab repository
      Use :ysrccommit: to link in places where line numbers were used.
      Trying to link to a line number with :ysrc: will produce an error.
      Add :ysrccommit: description to manual prog.rst
      Improve documentation abuot :ref: and Linking to `inheritanceGraph`
      Fix link to example figure :width:
      small fix
      ENABLE_MPI=0 until we find out how to use MPI in clang.
      Remove -fdce from clang compiler flags.
      Remove duplicate ENABLE_USEFUL_ERRORS section.
      Fix #113, compile without warnings with -DENABLE_LOGGER=OFF
      Workaround libeigen bug with g++ 9: enable warning deprecated-copy
      Workaround issue 115: allow 26 or 27 acoustic events. Results vary depending on some library versions. Probably due to floating point numerical error. See https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/issues/115 for the list of suspects.
      Add tags: fast to package building. So that 7pak can safely run 15 concurrent jobs.
      More readable 'useful errors' section. Reaname USE_WARNING_ERRORS→WORKAROUND_LIBRARY_WARNINGS, use ALL_ENABLED_USEFUL_ERRORS.
      Prepare code to enable float-conversion warning, never use abs(…) without std:: due to this mess: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21392627/abs-vs-stdabs-what-does-the-reference-say
      Fix bug found by float-conversion warning: the x,y,z were converted to Eigen::Index and they were interpreted as column numbers in the matrix: 0,1 or 2. (note: in ubuntu 16.04, we have to calculate this with some extra routine, I've put an assert to make sure that any potential problem is caught early).
      Use -Wfloat-conversion -Wcast-align warnings, make sure that older cmake versions do not switch back to C++11, use C++14 instead.
      Add -Wformat-nonliteral -Wdisabled-optimization -Wtrampolines -Wpointer-arith -Wswitch-bool -Wwrite-strings
      Add -Wnon-virtual-dtor warning.
      Note what warnings were not fixed (some are in external libraries, some are not worth it).
      Add more comments.
      Don't print warnings that are not errors. Except for 'maybe-uninitialized' and '#warning' pragama. These are always printed, beacuse they are very useful even when some libraries trigger it.
      Now gitlab will start checks/tests as soon as the previous make_* is finished. This will be a bit faster.
      Add 15 minute timeout for test and check jobs in gitlab CI
      Mention link to documentation of :ysrccommit: when :ysrc: tried to link to specific line number.
      Mention R"""(raw text)""" docstring style in the documentation.
      Try different JOBSNUM setting trying to maximize gitlab runners efficiency.
      Adjust JOBSNUM setting in order to maximize gitlab runners efficiency. Now a fully ccached gitlab-ci job is 10 minutes, while a non-ccached (recompilation) job is 34 minutes.
      The check scripts are testing whether the tested feature is present in yade.config.features (sometims the tests were failing)
      OpenFOAM test uses relative paths, so that it will work in other places too.
      Fix compilation with -DENABLE_OPENMP=OFF cmake parameter.
      Fix compilation with -DUSE_QT5=OFF, yade --test and --check are OK. But py/yade/remote.py fails with No module named 'PyQt4' (maybe it's time to remove QT4 support completely?)
      Fix yade --test with PotentialBlock debug build
      Add -DENABLE_MPI=OFF test to .gitlab-ci.yml
      Add more gitlab-ci tests: (1) debug build (2) minimal build (3) other settings are set different than the default values.
      Rename _other → _opposite, add comment explaining that this gitlab-CI job is meant to try cmake settings opposite to the default values. But don't touch these that turn off compilation of significant amount of code.
      Disable some gitlab-CI jobs depending on whether it is a Work In Progress merge request or not.
      Increase CI test timeout to 25 minutes.
      Add check test of avoidSelfInteractionMask based on https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/682290
      Fix #118 fix #106, .add_property(mask, … ) was ignored without MPI.
      Add 'make doc' for debug build, only master and non-WIP merge requests.
      Improve comments in Logging.hpp.
      Update .mailmap
      Use std::is_same to check if CGAL's Traits::RT == Real
      Add file with commonly used namespace aliases: lib/base/Namespaces.hpp
      start journey towards `long double`, `float128` and `multiprecision::mpfr` as Real, by working on issue #57: add namespace yade (this commit has "simple files" only)
      Add namespace yade (simple files only)
      Add namespace yade (more simple files) - fix https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/issues/57
      Make sure there is no #include inside namespace. Mostly OPENGL related.
      Let all python modules (files with macro BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE) use correctly namespace yade
      Clean namespace pollution: remove useless 'using …' directives.
      ctags cannot sometimes detect class names, when they are inside macros, etc. So create anchors inside forCtags{};
      Change Math.hpp to use namespace yade. Minimal changes only. No cleanup yet for boost::multiprecision or float128.
      ClassFactory and Serializable use yade namespace. Update documentation respectively.
      Update customConverters.cpp respectively.
      Extract duplicate CGAL 'using … = ' directives into single file lib/base/AliasCGAL.hpp
      Explain a bit more in the docs how namespace collisions can be dangerous.
      Fix clang compilation
      Improve script for automated testing of all yade examples (copy example directory to /tmp with auxiliary files together)
      Add counter that prints progress when testing all examples. Improve instructions.
      Fix debug mode compilation.
      small fix
      Improve code readibility.
      Write documentation section about adding new python / C++ modules.
      Remove duplicates of declaring std=c++14. with set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON) cmake adds 'std=gnu++14' by itself. So it is configurable in single place.
      Note in documentation that FOREACH is deprecated.
      Remove few more FOREACH. Now all are removed from core/ and lib/
      One more example in documentation.
      Start work on test_GUI for gitlab pipeline.
      don't call thread info in gdb (on some gdb versions it doesn't work), add tag for ctags.
      Make sure that pyInteractionContainer is not accessing a body with id==-1, which caused crash in GUI Inspect.
      testGui.py can now switch the GUI Inspector tabs, makes screenshots and exits correctly
      Add extra check in testGui.sh (bash) if screenshots were generated by testGui.py (python)
      Small cleanup, add some comments.
      Move GUI test into test_definition, but add guard called NO_GUI to skip this testing when required.
      Make screenshot after yade finishes.
      Enable gui test for opensuse
      Revert "Enable gui test for opensuse" (GUI does not work with freeglut 3.0, so OpenSuse default install is not going to work until freeglut fixes their bug)
      Move test scripts into gui direcotry.
      Move screenshot routine to another file.
      Make the test a bit more interesting by manipulating yade.qt.Renderer() parametrs ('display' GUI tab)
      Move makeScreenshot.py file.
      Install the GUI test helper, so that import will find it.
      some small fixes
      Create a test loop, in case if we wanted more GUI tests.
      Add testGuiEmpty.py for testing a totally empty simulation.
      Small fix of bash loop
      Use a different name for screenshots, better sorts alphabetically.
      use full xterm path
      make test more realistic by simulating clicks on screen.
      Tell xterm to pass everything to gitlab-CI
      Some xterms do not support output to stdout. So let's use tail.
      Make sure we have necessary tools.
      Add notes how to run testGui.sh script locally.
      Make sure there is no tail command left running in the background
      Do all GUI testing via mouse clicks.
      Improve comments in testGui.sh, better checks if needed tools are present.
      Add note that testGui.sh should find files automatically just like checkList.py
      Shorter sleeps, draw bounding volume.
      Place clang-format off/on guards before/after every YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_* macro.
      Try to find some nice .clang-format. However YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_* macros need // clang-format off, // clang-format on, before and after
      Change ColumnLimit to 140 and sort the keywords (easier to compare with documentation).
      Use glBegin, glEnd blocks with indentation, like they were indented before. Allow MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 2.
      Some small adjustments trying to reduce total number of changes.
      Note in documentation about reformatting.
      Fix the includes that will be missing after a 'full reformat' is performed.
      Fix comiplation problem due to ordering of includes after 'full reformat', now they are in this order: lib, core, pkg, gui
      Add clang-formatter.sh script, tested on ubuntu 18.04 18.10 19.04, buster, bullseye, sid suse15.1. It accepts (1) dir (2) file (3) checks for uncommitted changes (4) prints stats afterwards.
      Make sure that .clang-format works on older linux distributions (xenial, stretch)
      Make sure that successive reformats do not change code again and again.
      temporarily don't reformat OpenGLWrapper.hpp (float128 changes are coming soon)
      Longer wait after self.clickOnScreen(…) in case if build servers are very slow.
      Wait max 5 seconds for Inspector window to appear, check every 0.25sec. (in case if build servers are very slow).
      Include boost/python/…/wrap_python.hpp instead of Python.h. Always as first one. See https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_71_0/libs/python/doc/html/building/include_issues.html
      A little more detailed energy check in checkSaveLoadClumps.py
      Fix broken static_assert in OpenGLWrapper, now we can be 100% sure that primary templates are never called. This is going to be very useful for high precision calculations.
      Add small note
      Change some forgotten `double` → `Real`
      Switch HydroForceEngine into using `Real`.
      Move debug test, check and doc into make_tmplate; Enable it like ASAN. Hopefully will not waste time on upload/download of huge debug artifacts.
      Remove excessive compiler identification checks. Leave only rudimentary one.
      Add clang test & check
      clang-format will align comments at end of the successive lines. Use empty line to start comments at different indentation.
      Detect intel compiler version.
      Add -Wreturn-local-addr to ALL_ENABLED_USEFUL_ERRORS
      Don't preemptively block float128 support (1.2f is float, 1.2L is long double, 1.2Q is quad; https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/floating_literal ; https://www.boost. org/doc/libs/1_71_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/float128.html)
      small cleanup, add links to yade-dem.org/doc/prog.html#sphinx-documentation in few places.
      Use PyErr_Print(); in case when importing python module 'raised unreported exception', to make python/C++ boundary easier to debug.
      Explain in documentation how to handle python/C++ exceptions and transfer them upwards to python.
      small clarification in documentation.
      extra newline is necessary for correct .. ipython:: parsing in .rst
      More clarification in documentation.
      Fix typo: alogrithms ↔ algorithms
      Auto retry gitlab-runner failed jobs.
      Remove unused mutex
      Make sure ThreadRunner isn't destructed while ThreadRunner::run() is running, which would result in a crash. Allow the running thread to finish early if it decided to check the shouldTerminate();
      testLibVersions only warns about non-matching version numbers. Does not fail the tests. Although these non-matching version numbers might have bad consequences later.
      Use native cmake's CGAL detection instead of cMake/FindCGAL.cmake file.
      Link conditionally with CGAL libraries
      Remove debug info
      Fix flags in make_opposite pipeline.
      Fix ENABLE_DEFORM compilation.
      Add test -DENABLE_VTK=OFF to the pipeline.
      reinstate pragma ignored "-Wcomment"
      Make sure that read-only attributes are shown in gray color (inactive) in  GUI Inspector.
      Update documentation about how to expose in GUI non-attributes, e.g. Interaction::isReal()
      Remove duplicate attribute registration in Body.hpp
      YADE_SPH : Remove duplicate attribute registration in State.hpp (not sure if they should be readonly, because that was the side effect of duplicate registration).
      Expose isReal() in GUI by adding a virtual py::dict pyDictCustom() const { … } function.
      Merge hint into main text.
      A more direct link to example of new function pyDictCustom()
      Add extra newline, to workaround gitlab from always showing this last line as changed.
      Mark suspicious line of code in core/Subdomain.cpp
      Propose a fix for Subdomain::probeIncoming
      Mark line with missing return.

      Fix last compilation warning
      Fix compilation errors with CGAL 4.11 (again), guys please use Tri.locate(CGT::Sphere(…)) and ->point().point()
      Update .mailcap
      Small improvement in SerializableEditor.py, it will now detect types starting with std:: or boost::
      Initial idea for fixing CGAL 4.13 interface changes.
      fix typo
      Add info about how to push a non-master branch into yade-dev
      Checked first 20 examples. Fixed 2. Created full list examples/list_of_examples.txt to track progress.
      Partial fix of postProcessValidMaurin2015.py
      Fixed postProcessing_sedim.py; added in list_of_examples.txt whether the example is explained inside the script.
      Checked next 25 examples. Added some explanations or very small fixes in 8 examples.
      Checked 10 more examples.
      Check 24 more scripts, fix 2.
      Check 12 examples. Fix 2.
      Check 8 more examples
      Checked 17 more examples. Didn't fix the 8 broken ones.
      Checked 18, fixed 2
      Checked 17 more examples
      Check 27 more examples
      Checked last 25 examples. Conclusion: 215 examples, 46 are not working at the moment. That is 21% of examples are broken.
      Fix bug#1813229. Class Inheritance graphs in Yade.pdf now have dpi=300 and larger font.
      I tried the -DENABLE_POTENTIAL_BLOCKS=ON -DENABLE_POTENTIAL_PARTICLES=ON examples. They start and seem to run, but still do not work.
      Oops, has some merge conflicts
      I tried PotentialBlocks once again. I am still suspicious about whether those examples work.
      Fix error GUI → Display → Gl1_CpmPhys : UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 87
      Adding Gl1_PotentialParticle().store=True to example file seems to fix the display issues. But there must be a reason why it is false by default?
      Comment out last remaining //TRVAR3(…) which was spamming the terminal.
      Fix indentation in list_of_examples.txt
      Checked all examples in doc/sphinx/tutorial.
      Walked again through all examples to identify the source of each SIGSEGV/SIGABRT segfault.
      Notes about what I achieved when trying to make this line work: 'from esys.escript import *'
      Two of FEMxDEM scripts started to sort-of work: biaxialSmooth.py and retainingSmooth.py
      Added missing references to my articles using yade. Also my first Quantum Mechanics paper ;)
      Maybe embedding videos with https will make them work on the website?

As a consequence, the fluid viscous contribution are multiplied by the fluid volume fraction at the square, and the second member includes a contribution from the solid phase. Also, the poiseuille validation script has been very slightly modified to account for recent code modification

      Critical bugfix for collision detection in periodic boundary conditions. Bounds lists were left partially unordered,  then some interactions were never detected (my toughest yade debugging until now).
      Minors & cosmetic.
      fix feature NewtonIntegrator::densityScaling
      Introduce a tolerance on overlap determination (in periodic BC only), avoiding false negative due to round-off errors. (usage in a separate commit).
      A simpler and faster version of spatialOverlapPeri. Only one call to floor(), ~20% speedup for ISCollider::action.  Tolerance introduced to fix detection failures.
      Keep the values of sorted bounds in the [0,size] range in ISCollider.
      small scale optimization in ISCollider
      Fix collision detection again (amending commit c7c8e6f62d452c8). Don't move bounds below the starting point of the sort, else partial (only) ordering can occure.
      Don't start blinking the 0-body when opening inspector + make it possible to un-highlight before/after closing the inspector by selecting empty space.

Raphael Maurin (9):
      getStressProfile: output format modification + add calculation of granular temperature and kinetic stress tensor
      Law2_ScGeom_ViscElPhys_Basic: add a new formulation + check     Add a new formulation of the law when imposing in the material young, poisson, and normal restitution coefficient.     The effective spring constants ks and kn are evaluated "classically" with the young modulus and the poisson's ratio.     The specificity of the formulation stands in the fact that it is the restitution coefficient of the contact (en = 2*en1*en2/(en1+en2)) that is imposed, and not the damping constant. To achieve this, the damping constant of the contact is evaluated resolving numerically the analytical expression 21 of [Schwager2007] (with a minus sign, there is a mistake in the article) with a Newton-Raphson algorithm (This was made by Francois Kneib). This does not seem to affect the calculation time.     With this formulation, there is no tangential viscous damping, and it is usually not possible to access value of normal restitution coefficient lower than 0.1 (in that case the numerical resolution does not converged in the maximum 15 iteration allowed in the code)     Together with the new formulation, add a short check script to verify that the imposed restitution coefficient is the one obtained.
      Law2_ScGeom_ViscElPhys_Basic: complete the documentation     Add a more precise documentation of the law integrating the last commit.     I didn't complete the formulation associated with Pournin2001 (precising en,es,tc) as I am not using it and I do not know it much.
      Fix compilation error in the documentation of Law2_ScGeom_ViscElPhys_Basic     Error inserted in commit d47b8574e8fcc2dc09b926404f08081f2194cfde

      Sign convention change for fCap, to be consistent with global framework. Plus other minor changes. As discussed in http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg10868.html and http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg10877.html
      Doc hyperlinks, and erase of commented lines
      Many changes towards a more consistent sign convention throughout the code for stresses and strains. Should fix e.g. https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/1381282. The goal is to know directly the meaning of a strain or stress value each time one is encountered. Relying on the classical Continuum Mechanics convention (editorial choice...). A global announcement is planned in a couple of days, in case some errors appear in the meantime.
      Other changes regarding sign convention. Add of deprecation warnings (existing in the code and at execution) in the doc. Fix of script-session2.py previously broken
      See https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/1394942 answer # 3
      Minor doc fixes
      Anecdotic doc change, see http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg10972.html
      Add of O.thisScene() function to know in which scene we are
      Add of sphSph parameter in plotDirections() to take into account only sph-sph interactions in polar histograms. Seems it does not modify really the plots, but it is easier to figure out with the parameter
      TSC engine: internal compaction now may consider isotropic tensile cases. See http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg11047.html

      add some references in yade-conference.bib
      Switch a private argument to public in HydroforceEngine.
      HydroForceEngine: minor fix + add an averaging function     Minor fix : modify some default value of the parameters, remove unecessary parameters.     Add a 1D averaging function which evaluate the average depth profiles of the solid volume fraction, the solid velocity, and the drag force.     The averaging is weighted by the volume occupied by the particles in the layer considered.
      Add new function to compute stress tensor depth profile.     Compute and return the stress tensor for each cell of height dz, between two limit points given by the user.     The stress tensor computed include contributions from both particles inertia and Love-Weber stress tensor. This last take into account only the part of the branch vector contained in the cell.
      Minor fix in getStressProfile.     The order of the argument in _utils.cpp was not the right one.
      HydroForceEngine: small modifications in the averaging function.     Perform the averaging also on the y and z component of the particle velocity, instead of only x before.

      Fixed a bug that appeared when running the uniaxial-post.py script from examples. Edited py/post2d.py to capture exception while importing Vector3 from minieigen.

jduriez (12):
      Correction of an error using psd() with monodisperse packings (false = False in python). Add of an explanatory message
      Few changes in capillary doc: assumption of null wetting angle, hyperlinks, and some comments in source code
      One forgotten change during previous commit about TriaxialStressController <-> 3DTriaxialEngine ? https://github.com/yade/trunk/commit/77bc6d75b780bcbad5bdadc5bb3645badb009cd9
      Adding mention of different save files kinds. Tried to comment differences, please correct if I was wrong
      Typos and precisions in capillary doc
      porosity() function infers now a volume value for non-periodic cases, rather than throwing an error. Positiv volume values eventually passed as argument override this inferred value
      porosity doc changed according to previous commit
      getStress() considers now an adequate volume value for non-periodic case (values passed as parameters may still also be taken into account)
      Re-introducing change from https://github.com/yade/trunk/commit/ab91b3cf8654f6d563dede10184e784a8ce84219, reverted since, without reason
      Improvement of https://github.com/yade/trunk/commit/05599b23808991dbfef6b85400c7ddd32be594e0 regarding volume computation in getStress for non periodic cases
      Typo in CapillaryPhys doc
      Parallelization of interaction loops in Law2_..._Capillarity (which is in fact not a LawFunctor handled by InteractionLoop). Moreover adopting the FOREACH iterator for the non-parallel flavour.

      Modifying JCFpm example scripts so that they still work after previous commit
      Re-put some commented lines, after discussion of this thread (https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg10185.html), thanks Anton. The comments solution is (at the moment ?) finally still used to avoid putting a new variable in VTKRecorder..

Klaus Thoeni (1):
      add CGAL link and delete libgmp3 from install list

Raphael Maurin (1):
      Change in the calculation of the normal and tangential stiffness and damping. The change affects only the behavior     when one of the two parameters is zero, e.g. for two particles with different stiffness k1 and k2, the contact     stiffness will always be k = k1*k2/(k1+k2). Before it gave the same except when k2 = 0 (respectively k1 = 0), where it     gave k = k1 (resp. k=k2). This is done to ensure continuity in the behavior when one of the two parameter tend     to zero.     Add a function contactParameterCalculation in Ip2_ViscElMat_ViscElMat_ViscElPhys to avoid code duplication.

In cpp, some commented lines to add (in the future ?) some post-pro features that could maybe break current saves of (existing ??) current users
      Commiting changes discussed briefly in https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg09979.html. Mainly written by L. Scholtes, they allow to vizualize with paraview some features of JCFpm classes.

Francois Kneib (4):
      Change the growParticles method behavior on clumps into Shop.cpp.     Now the clumps are not grown if the clump members are fixed (i.e blockedDOFs='XYZxyz').
      Workaround for a Ubuntu 12.10 bug that gave a segmentation fault when launching Yade.     The importation of "_io" is made sooner, at the beginning of yade python executable. Changes applied to core/main/main.py.in.
      Handle the cohesive contact between a sphere and a facet.     Created Ig2_Facet_Sphere_ScGeom6D inheriting from Ig2_Facet_Sphere_ScGeom. It precomputes the 3 rotations DOFs and creates a ScGeom6D contact geometry.     All modifications made into /pkg/dem/Ig2_Facet_Sphere_ScGeom.cpp and hpp.
      Changes in Grid.ccp/hpp.     - Improve documentation for Ig2_Sphere_GridConnection_ScGridCoGeom::go()     - Add a new law (Law2_ScGridCoGeom_CohFrictPhys_CundallStrack) that allows a cohesive contact (without rotational moments) between a Sphere and a GridConnection.

Bruno Chareyre (68):
      Give the git clone adress that will work always (previous one is blocked at 3SR lab)
      enable setting FlowEngine by number of steps or by deformation aplitude
      a fix in bibtex
      -remove excess verbosity
      - add thread number attribute to change the number of thread of interactionLoop dynamicaly during simulations. Also usefull combined with parallel engine (for fine grain tuning of thread number in each subprocess)
      1. Add thread number to parallel engine, can be changed dynamicaly. Uncouples the number of threads in parallel engines and in slaves.     2. Enable nested parallel regions (disabled on many systems by default) else the parallel engine is doing no good
      1. Replace one loop on cells by an optimized vector<Cell> iterator     2. Clean an horrible block of code (not only ugly, it was also slow)
      - introduce a position buffer for faster updates of volumes
      Use retriangulation conditions more consistently. The solvers are not swapped before a given fraction of the permutation interval now, to reduce overheads.
      small change in the initialization logic, now defining the two position buffers if "first"
      make ompThread an attribute of Engine, as it likely to be used more and more in the future. It is then inherited by InteractionLoop and ParallelEngine
      Parallelize volume updates and the computation of fluid forces
      fix a typo introduced in previous commit, giving compile error in FlowEngine
      remove traces of the SpherePadder module, which is broken and unmaintained (with author's agreement)
      make grids periodic
      use EpsVolPercent_RTRG consistently in periodic flow: negative value is ignored, just like the non-periodic case
      Adapt setContactProperties to pass argument in radians to Shop::setContactFriction
      -fix conversion mistake (radian/degree)
      update variable names to denote the unit of friction angle (rad), and make this explicit in the documentation
      - include elasticity in the normal lubrication force     - fix ompThreads assignment in flow engine, resulting in numThreads=-1 by default, then "libgomp: Out of memory"
      Fix the F9-F12 keys binding for IPython>=0.12
      -add the correct prefactor in normal lubrication relation     -overlap the two triangulations during one iteration in order to have the "previous" forces     defined in the normal lubrication equation
      Update the documentation of the ompThreads attribute.
      - fix again the offset of ids in SpherePack.toSimulation (previous fix was assuming two bodies per clump)
      - fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/923929 again, as shown by François it could still happen in some cases (see example in the bug report)
      - remove the check/throw when generating aperiodic 2D packings, since the algorithm actually support that.
      Define O.engine with a default list at startup, with example script and notes in the documentation.
      remove utils prefix
      - Updates and improvements in the triax-tutorial material     - smallfix in a note in introduction.rst
      fixed version of the triax script for clumps

      fix compile warning (actually fix the functions as well, as they were not returning results at all!)
      - doc fix
      -remove remaining debug lines
      periodic update of publications
      fix a typo in bibtex file, +1 ref
      - one fix in articles, yet more references in conferences
      fix/add Tran's reference
      - use "orientation" parameter in utils.box (fix bug/1111514)
      - improved version of TriaxialStressController, controling not onlt stress but also strain rate     - making the interface more similar (but still not exactly like) PeriTriaxController.     - TriaxialCompressionEngine and ThreeDTriaxialEngine become almost useless     - reflected in the example script which now uses only TriaxialStressController
      -micro-fix (no need to define an initial timestep)
      -code cleaning
      - fix the default value of orientation in utils.box. [1,0,0,0] is NOT a quaternion.
      -add a few python bindings to the periodic engine for manipulations of the internal tesselation
      -fix the detection of (not) already computed tesselation
      -make volume() functional also when PeriodicFlow is actually in use
      uncouple the compilation of flow code and linsolv, so that it is possible to effectively compile the flow engines without cholmod
      remove useless "sigma_iso" and "isAxisymetric" members from TTController
      - make an old engine deprecated, not compiled now, to be removed later
      more #ifdef guards, to allow flow engine without linsolv
      remove sigma_iso from the triax example script
      fix syntax error in a doc string (blocking the buildbot https://yade-dem.org/buildbot/builders/yade-full/builds/1741/steps/shell_3/logs/stdio)
      -deprecation warnings in ThreeD and TriaxialCompression engines
      -change the default value of FlowEngine::pressureForce, a flow engine is supposed to compute a flow by default...
      smallfix in example script
      - 3 new references
      - add "Open Source Discrete Element Method" explicitely in the home page, google has to find us
      nicer documentation of equations for stiffness definition
      remove useless #define
      - ship a copy of ipython_directive.py from ipython/HEAD for ipython 0.13
      ipython version was checked in two different places, forgot the second one. Still no confirmation of the fix.
      - some lines comited by mistake, sorry for that.
      - escape crash on non-iterable __doc__ (some qt class)     - define new attributes needed for ipython_directives.py >= 0.13     - fix existing *.rst to use strictly 3 blank spaces in multiline directives (i.e. "   ...:")
      - reference name Tran2012a appearing twice -> renaming Tran2012b
      - re-introduce the @supress of Christian (removed during experiments)

Donia Marzougui (5):
      Fix the computation of viscous forces by using the     correct positions of bodies (updated in     buildTriangulation), and fix some variable names.
      Remove fictious spheres from the computation of edge surfaces (employed in the computation of viscous forces)
      Correct the computation of the viscous and normal stress per particle.
      Correct the sign of some parameters in the computation of the viscous forces.
      Correct the normal lubrication force.

Francois Kneib (24):
      Continue the implementation of grids :     - add GridConnexion Aabb     - add GridNode-GridNode Ig2 functor : Ig2_GridNode_GridNode_GridNodeGeom6D     - add GridNode-GridNode contact geometry : GridNodeGeom6D     - add an example script : examples/grids/Simple_Grid_Falling.py     - update utils.py (minor change)
      Add the possibility of avoiding the contact detection between a group of particle.     -> the vector "avoidSelfInteractionMasks" contains a list of masks : all particles having the same mask will not collide if this mask is inside this list.     -> the "mayCollide" method now check this too.     -> avoidSelfInteractionMasks can be set in python with a list of int.
      Add the Sphere-GridConnection frictionnal contact :     -> new contact geometry : ScGridCoGeom     -> new Ig2 : Ig2_Sphere_GridConnection_ScGridCoGeom     -> new Law2 : Law2_ScGridCoGeom_FrictPhys_CundallStrack     -> update utils.py to handle the new contact type (using avoidSelfInteractionMasks)
      Merge branch 'master' of github.com:yade/trunk
      Add the contact following and avoid multiple contact when a sphere is sliding on a grid.
      -Grids : Fix some minor bugs in Ig2_Sphere_GridConnection_ScGridCoGeom::go(...).     -Collider : Change the vector of masks "avoidSelfInteractionMasks" to a single mask "avoidSelfInteractionMask".
      Create and correct documentation.
      Grids :     - modify the rendering.     - Apply correct DEM laws in utils.py to set right kn, ks, kr, and ktw. Now the grid behavior no longer depends on the spacial discretization you make.
      Modified setContactFriction method.     Now it has to be used with an angle in radian unit, no longer in degrees.
      Try to fix documentation in this files, everywere "yref" appears in the online documentation.
      Fix Grid periodicity, and allow periodic sphere-grid contacts.
      Disable a boring warning into the grid construction.
      Fix a bug in SpherePack.toSimulation. There was a big problem when you tried to add clumped SpherePack (with makeClumpCloud() for example).
      Corrected toSimulation() (for the last time I hope :-) ).
      Fix a bug in growParticles(...) method.     Growing a clump is now really homothetic. Before that, growing clumps seemed to be homothetic but at the next timestep the original position of members was reseted.
      Add Inelastic ChainedCylinder behavior law (by Ignacio Olmedo).     Create inelastic material and related physics, Ip2 and Law2.     Example script and complete documentation will come soon.
      Add the ability to save to a file a SpherePack containing some Clumps.     Into SpherePack : now the toFile method writes a fifth column containing the clump number (-1 if the sphere isn't clumped). The fromFile method uses the new information to append clumped Spheres.     Into Shop : loadSpheresFromFile method is modified to read and return the fifth column. Old files with 4 columns are still compatible.     Into CapillaryTriaxialTest and CohesiveTriaxialTest : Shop::loadSpheresFromFile is sometimes used here, so remove the clumpId information to match the "BasicSphere" typedef.
      getStress(...) method : exclude gridNode-gridNode contacts for the stress computing.     growParticles(...) method : avoid growing gridNode and gridConnection.
      Fix some Grids bugs.
      A minor spelling correction.
      Add a little class summary and explanations into Grid.hpp.     Fix a bug into utils.py when creating a Grid in a non-periodic scene.
      In the sphinx documentation, add the https GitHub read-only method : git clone https://github.com/yade/trunk.git
      Avoid GridNode-GridNode contact stiffnesses (kn and ks) to be changed when the growParticles(...) method is used. (GridNodes are not concerned by this method).
      Add a missing space in the dependencies code lines.

François Kneib (1):
      Correct a remaining bug into the toSimulation() python function.

Jan Stransky (9):

      -FlowEngine uses boost::thread to precompute triangulation and Cholesky factor while yade is running
      - interplate using barycenters of old trangulation, instead of voro-center of new triangulation, avoids inconsistencies     - make sure voidVolume is positive (FIXME: hardcoded number a.t.m.)

Bruno Chareyre (72):
      - (failed) attempt to fix the documentation of export.py
      - fix doc generation for the export module. Still some fixes needed concerning doc convention (wrong parameter declaration for some functions)
      - makeCloud can now generate spheres on a plane (see https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/175606)
      remove unused bool "is2D".
      - makeCloud handles periodic 2D clouds with uniform distribution and psd
      - yet more fixes. The auto-setting of cell.size was not correct (typo in components)
      - code cleaning
      - Documentation of the capillary law (warn users on distanceFactor and neverErase flags, as in http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg07391.html.
      - 2 additional references
      - make body iterators jump empty slots, as suggested and discussed here: http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg07406.html     - revert the (now useless) fix of r2961, similar tests can be removed in many places after the change in pointer logic is well tested.     - remove a script, as agreed by Christian (https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/178830)
      - add/use the "neverErase" flag in Hertz laws.
      - back to ordinary vector<>:iterator for bodyContainer
      - smart body pointers again, also fixing the erase(0) case inside begin().
      - remove the if(body) test in GSTS loop.
      - attempt to fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/897237     - small fix in the theoretical background
      Should finally fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/897237
      - capillary model: nullify Fcap and volume when P changes from something to zero     - remove the if(!b) test in a few important places (proof of concept + don't waste time doing the same test twice)
      - fix wrong shape type testing that was giving wronf solid volume.
      - update publications
      - fix one bug mentionned in https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/901146 (makeCloud with undefined num and psd)     - more articles
      - normalize psdCumm2 after the scaling, not before (since the scaling is determined from absolute psdCumm2).
      - make it possible to include bodies larger than period conditionally, using allowLargerThanPeriod flag (as discussed in https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/181411, thanks Giulia for the scipt)     - document undocumented parameters of bodies creation (in utils.sphere)
      - enable interaction of two larger-than period bodies (e.g. cylinder vs. box) in addition to previous commit.
      - point to the "allowBiggerThanPeriod" flag in the LOG_FATAL message.
      - improvements in TW interface so that one can save and load "state" files to be used for defining deformations (this will actually be used by E. Ando for analyzing experimental data!)     - code cleaning
      - make deformation analysis possible for arbitrary simulations (no longer depends on TriaxialEngine for defining the bounds)
      - fixed undefined variable when Triaxial engine is not present
      - erase bodies before adding spheres from file
      - Fix typo (thanks for pointing out Klaus, actually the "i" was correct: elastic-plastic means that the law is incrementaly elastic OR plastic, while elasto-plastic laws can be both at the same time)
      - big reorganization of the triangulation lib, which becomes a template library. Usage of different "info" classes for different engines is now possible, so that TWrapper doesn't have to instantiate useless variables inherited from the flow problem, and vice-versa. Will also worj for periodic flow model coming soon.     - general code cleaning and removal of old files     - a few hyperlinks fixed in *.bib's
      - remove custom dependencies breaking compilation
      Merge the "collide" branch to trunk (branch history at https://code.launchpad.net/~bruno-chareyre/yade/collide2)

      - account for sweepLength in bounds comparisons of Collider::probeVolume()     - removed unused file
      - Collider: fix the probe function (account for current body's position +  typo in one comparison)     - Newton: remove the useless "force" from damping2nd parameters, don't apply meanfield vel when not periodic (only diff is it avoids a multiplication of null matrix and vector), make gravity attribute work correctly     - GravityEngine: add LOG_ERROR on deprecation (LOG_WARNING are not displayed in prebuilt package right?), better use Newton::gravity to save cpu time.     - Clump.hpp: fix the template function that was using the old saveMaximaVelocity, use the new saveMaximaDisplacement instead     - PeriIsoCompressor: never pause() in some c++ code, since it resuults in stuck GUI without a chance to run more timesteps
      - dispatching: don't make bboxes larger for static bodies     - gravity : deprec. warning     - collider: try and fix Anton's crash (https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg08256.html and next in the thread)     - Newton: workaround the resetForce bug in OMP build (https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/923929)
      - small changes left behind in a previous commit (fix the "undefined IPCells") problem
      - include periodic PeriodicFlow in the triangulation lib
      - Compute the critical timestep correctly when clumps are present.
      - make the "smoothing" of strain rate evolution configurable via a registered attribute (default=unchanged behavior)
      - tell more explicitely that Young/Poisson is interpreted differently in different functors in their respective doc     - make the LWStress function return pyList instead of tuple     - documentation in makeCloud     - default stiffness are zero, not NaN

Francois Kneib (4):
      Added the interaction between cohesive sphere and cohesive chained cylinder. Created Ig2_Sphere_ChainedCylinder_CylScGeom6D and Law2_CylScGeom6D_CohFrictPhys_CohesionMoment in Cylinder.cpp. Created CylScGeom6D in CylScGeom6D.cpp. Moved CylScGeom from Cylinder.cpp to CylScGeom6D.cpp
      Interaction test between a cohesive sphere and a cylinder.
      Fixed some bugs in Ig2_Sphere_ChainedCylinder_CylScGeom6D() and Ig2_Sphere_ChainedCylinder_CylScGeom(). Now the contact is rightly followed when a sphere move along a chained cylinder. It works with frictional cohesive or frictional contacts.

      utils.shiftBodies function is added to move bodies without velocity update.
      1. in utils.sumTorques and utils.sumForces py::tuple has been changed to py::list. I think it is more convinient.     2. added RuntimeError() to checkTestTriax.py. Bruno, are you agree?
      1. Added new checkWeight test to --check scripts     2. It is not neccessary now to add the script name into the checkList.py, just drop a new script into the scripts/test/checks directory

Bruno Chareyre (130):
      - Rename Cohesive law functor with "6D" as in "ScGeom6D"     - Same for chanedCylinder's Ig2 functor.     - update scripts.
      - Fix compile crashers due to bad include paths.
      - Keep robust kernel the default.
      - re-enable cohesive chain test
      - declare deprecated names (part of r2543)     - revert experimental parameters previously commited by mistake in cylinder script
      - Make TriaxialTest behave correctly by default - as it used to, i.e. generate the correct number of particles in a cube of size 1.
      - disable the last comparison on velocities (see https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg06178.html)
      - add the mandatory "bool periodic" parameter for makeCloud.
      - Prepare linear solver usage in FlowEngine.     - Some cleaning.     - Add inexes to triangulation cells fro vectorization.
      - remove a warning in Tesselation.cpp     - fix FlowBonding sphere for first iteration and a few other things     - make GaussSeidel virtual in FBS
      - handle different solvers.     - small optimization on dt divisions.
      - FlowEngine : rewrite updateVolume so that cell volumes are not computed twice.     - Remove irrelevant remark in SCPE     - Some missing "6D" here and ther in decorations (could affect only devirtualized build)
      - Implement tensile plasticity and add the corresponding parameters in CohFrictPhys.
      - recent commits broke or modified something in cohesive law. The reg. test  points it out.
      - restore default CohFrict behaviour
      - PeriTriax : remove the constant-distance approximation in stress definition, using wrapped coordinates instead of radii.     - Get back standalone energy tracing in ECL.
      - Cylinders : handle cylinder-sphere contacts with a fictious state representing interpolated motion between nodes and passed to ScGeom     - Cylinders : implement CundallStrack for interaction between 3 bodies (1 body + 2 nodes)     - Cylinders : a number of fixes - no more bugs it seems     - Cylinders : handle zero-sized element for terminating chains     - Cylinders : update scripts; add example script chained-cylinder-roots.py, with cylinders, spheres, and boxes     - Ig2_Box_Sphere_ScGeom : small class name fixes ("6D")     - utils.py : adapt cylinders linking     - ElasticContactLaw : don't use Body::byId when possible     - ScGeom6D : put quaternion normalization between #ifdef guards (debug only)
      - clean the script.
      - recommit 2608 with fixed reg test (making ratcheting correction negligeable with dist=.999999999999999999*size)     - also fix the compile errors
      - r2608 again, sorry. Local tests are invalidated by last changes in setDynamic, but the commit is correct.
      - finish implementation of contacts tracking on chained cylinders.     - some cleaning and doc update
      Fix : mistake in prev. commit while cleaning cylinder code.
      - recommit 2617 without the autoformating from kbibtex.
      - Doc : give precise references for triaxial algorithms.
      - Deeper integration of isDynamic semantic : skip velocity integration, damping, DOFs blocking, and exact spherical rotations, when !isDynamic. 0-density bodies should be safe.     - Partial DOFs blocking is not implemented yet.
      - ratcheting documentation : improve and unify source and inline versions.
      - As in r2615 : skip velocity update, damping, DOFs blocking, and exact spherical rotations, when !isDynamic. 0-density bodies should be safe.     This is a merging r2615 with the per-DOF blocking and clump handling from r2621.
      - updated FIXME, it seems we do the same thing twice
      -Fix kinetic energy definition.
      - Fix stripes display     - Add secondary light and register light parameters     - define specular exponent for smoother display     - define and use GL display lists

      -As in r2615 and r2622 (both reverted), and partialy in r2626 : skip acceleration, per-dof blocking, damping, and velocity update for bodies and clumps in case of DOF_ALL blocking (per DOF operations are useless in such case).     Please don't revert unless there is a reason to compute DOF_ALL's acceleration and it is guaranteed bug-free (see list). Discussion more than welcome, of course.
      - Fix one mistake in previous commit (incrementing angVel even for asphericals), sorry.     - Move clump damping after the foreach(member) loop, so that it will damp the total acceleration at clump's level.
      - Don't damp clump members. Instead, compute undamped acceleration and damp it at the clump's level.     - Similar mechanism implemented for DOF's blocking : compute unblocked accelerations and block at the end (remember blocking one DOF triggers tests and divisions).     - Still possible optimizations (especially for spherical rotations and translations), see https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/clump-forces.     - One FIXME : aspherical damping is not correct a.t.m. since it uses torque where angAccel should be provided (suggested fix in sources).     - Probably fixes a few inconsistencies in previous commits.
      - Missing in last commit (fix builbot failure)
      -Fix sphere rendering for closing/opening qtview (closing was deleting existing display lists, new view was empty)     -Make quality apply for striped spheres as well     -Make it possible to turn duplicated spheres on/off in periodic BC     -Separate GLUT and striped spheres functions for clarity     -Optimize stripes rendering with GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
      - A checkTest for triaxial simulations.
      - Add a function (and python wrapper) computing the exact mean stress in each sphere.
      -fix compile error in prev commit.
      - Integrate check tests in yade options (see README).     - Handle PBCs in Shop::getStressLWForEachBody (not tested)
      - uncouple Hsize and trsf, add setters for attributes Cell::trsf and Cell::refSize, update all scripts. (see http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg06101.html and next in thread).
      - Fix some temporary stuff left behind (safe but useless) + get back one line of comment removed by mistake.
      - update periodicity documentation     - rename Hsize->hSize to be consistent with names convention.     - remove a duplicated ref and add a CGAL ref
      - one file left behind in last commit, sorry.
      - Add resetTrsf() to set trsf without side effects.     - minor updates of attributes doc to be consistent with recent changes.
      -Don't maintain refSize in setHsize, in hope that we will not drag it forever, as suggested in https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg06836.html.
      - Fic classname and give working example.
      - update bodyStressTensor doc.
      makecloud update (recommit after fix)           - Fix psd transformation from mass distrib to number distrib.           - Make sure the function will always return the number of particles required by the user as soon as it is psecified.           - If num is specified, generate sizes the deterministic way by descending order.           - make porosity parameter optional and give it a default value.           - update doc and script.
      - make Cell.size read/write for faster hSize setting.     - improve and simplify documentation (the older method is no longer documented)
      small typo in property name ("sizes" instead of "size")
      - Move older or redundant interface between #ifdef CELL_BACKW_COMPAT guards.     - Replace refSize by current size in PeriTriax     - forget adding the "s" in "cell.sizes", since existing scripts are already using "cell.size" -> fix sphinx doc about this.
      - some more Cell doc. After typing the paragraph on display, I realize w'd better not update refHSize when trsf=s-------------- This line and the following will be ignored --------------
      - some more cell doc.
      As discussed on the list:     - Don't update refHSize when trsf is defined     - Update it when hSize (like before) or size are assigned     - use current size in PeriEngine     - remove unneccesary cell attributes     - replace setBox by size     - update doc (atributes and header) consistently

Chiara Modenese (19):
      1. Move alphas parameters to FrictMat as discussed with Bruno (harmonic-average of them is introduced in Ip2 functor).      2. Forgot one inequality when plasticity is applied (maybe I do not like tests so much :-) Sorry, anyway).
      - Adjust definition of maximum strength for rolling resistance (thanks to Bruno for suggestion).
      - Get rid of prevNormal (MindlinPhys inherits again from FrictPhys)     - Small changes to HM (I added the code for the moment rotation but using quaternions, work in progress to use the incremental formulation instead of that)
      - Add incremental formulation for the moment rotation (bending only) to HM law (it is very similar to the code for the shear part as written in ScGeom - it has been tested but feedbacks are welcome).     PS Let me know if you are interested to have it also in "Law2_ScGeom6D_CohFrictPhys_CohesionMoment" where actually the total formulation is already present.     @Bruno: maybe in ScGeom we could add this incremental formulation too?
      - Add relAngVel function to ScGeom (a similar version can be called from python as done for incidentVel)     @Bruno: I would like to add the incremental formulation to CFLaw, how do you suggest to do that? Maybe I can use a bool something like (useIncrementalForm)?
      - Add the possibility to calculate bending and twisting moments using the incremental formulation in both CFLaw and HMLaw;     - Add maximum elastic torsional moment in CFLaw (it should be computed using normal force, I will see how to compute it somehow);     - Fix mistake in mindlin.py example script.
      - Add a seed parameter to makeCloud, particleSD and particleSD2 functions. The parameter is used to initialize the random number generator.
      - Add calculation of fabric tensor for periodic cell as according to Satake (bib is updated too). The tensor can also be spit into two different parts each of them related to strong and weak contact forces respectively.     - Small changes in HM.
      - Calculation of fabric tensor takes care of the sign of normal force (I think this is the way to do it if we have cohesive forces but I will check again in the existing literature). Also the tensor can be split into two parts according to the mean contact force or a threshold value if this is going to be specified (thanks Vincent for suggestion).
      - Add a function to HMLaw which computes the ratio of sliding contacts.     - Adjust the sign convention in the computation of the fabric tensor. Now the tensor can also be split into tensile and compressive part (simply setting the threshold value equal to 0 - added documentation about that).     - Rename (for the fabric tensor function only) compressionPositive to revertSign (that is the meaning indeed - work in progress to use the scene flag and make automatic distinction whichever law is used).
      - Average stress tensor of periodic cell can also be spit into two contributions, given a threshold value (mean force by default).
      - Forgot the reference (sorry). Fix doc.
      - Add formulation for determination of time step for elastic spheres according to Rayleigh wave speed.
      Fix small bug in HM (only in case of viscous damping).
      - Wrap Eigen function to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Matrix3r in py     - Small fix in HM
      - For now, add 2d version of particleSD (discrete distribution) - for other type of distributions (like the one generated by makeCloud), something similar can be done.
      - Fix color map in shop (thanks Vaclav).
      - Fix bug in Periodic Boundary. scene->cell->prevVelGrad was never updated. It was equivalent to apply homoDeform=2 in place of homoDeform=3. (Thanks, Vaclav)
      - fix bug 1) as discussed in (https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/169689)

Janek Kozicki (10):
      plot.py: added `legendPosition` and `legendPositionSecondary` so we can decide     where the legend should be placed, by default it is 'upper left' and 'upper right'
      Added yade.utils.voxelPorosity and yade.utils.voxelPorosityTriaxial. It allows calculating porosity at any arbitrary sub-volume of a whole sample. See included documentation.
      small documentation fix
      standalone example almost works. I still have some problem with sample randomness, and exact answers.
      Added another variation of simple scene - this one is for energy tracking
      added nice legend to the plots
      more flexibility, few more parameters on the top of the script.
      better default parameters, use dict(...) to read O.energy.items()
      last correction for simple scene energy tracking example - I forgot to commit changes in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw     but in fact maybe better if those methods for calculating elastic normal & shear energy would be moved somewhere else, maybe to shop? I'm not sure.
      fix warning,     add plastic dissipation tracking

LawTester now has most data as Vector6r instead of 2xVector3r. The syntax changed (backwards-compat with warnings, sorry), path should be disPath, ptOurs, ptGeom, rotOurs, rotGeom is now in uGeom and uTest     4.

      1. Make batch accept multiple scripts on the command line (see --help)     2. Change syntax for blockedDOFs to be 'xyZ' rather than ['x','y','rz'] (assigning is backwards-compatible with warning)     3. Remove rests of devirt-functors; I thought I've done it already...
      1. Create abstract KinematicEngine, allow kinematic engine composition with + (thanks to Jan for suggesting that)     2. Move all KinematicEngine's to pkg/common/KinematicEngines.{hpp,cpp}     3. Change accels in GLViewer so that x,X,y,Y,z,Z make rhe respective axis point upwards etc     4. Change g/G to enable/disable grid (or selectively enable if pressed multiple times)     5. Remove button images in the qt4 ui, use unicode symbols instead     6. Make batch referesh once in 30s by default instead of 5s to avoid congestion on slow uplinks
      1. Add forgotten KinematicEngines.{c,h}pp files     2. Remove GroupRelationData & mgpost (is now at https://code.launchpad.net/~yade-dev/yade/mgpost)
      1. Fix accidental typo, sorry...
      1. Make middle-click paste path to variable in the ui     2. Clean up newton integrator; aspherical integration not called for things with 0 in inertia to avoid nans; this also fixed the problem of inverted normal with Wall
      1. Fix NewtonIntegrator for clumps, blockedDOFs &c; msg will be sent to yade-dev     2. Make static attributes properly hyperlinked and documented in the ui     3. Fix yref in L3Geom

      1. Fix an error in Law2_L3Geom_FrictPhys_ElPerfPl (forces were applied at the step the interaction broke); results are now identical to ScGeom/CundallStrack (in the normal sense at least)     2. Add the possibility to specify y-data as functions returning y-data names themselves (see scripts/tests/energy.py)     3. Merge 2 consecutive loops in NewtonIntegrator for clumps     4. Rename plot.legendPosition, plot.legendPositionSecondary to plot.legendLoc (tuple of 2 values), to make it consistent with matplotlib terminology (pylab.legend(...,loc=...))
      1. utils.{sphere,facet,wall} funcs take fixed=True|False now (instead of dynamic=False|True, which gives warning now and will be removed)     2. Make space in the 3d recenter scene     3. x,y,z (X,Y,Z) now set up axis (see help of the 3d), grid is toggled with g only     4.  Remove Shop::defaults and few other obsolete funcs     5. Fix bug in torsionweighting in LawTester     6. Rename Ig2_*_L3Geom_Inc to Ig2_*_L3Geom, update .py scripts     7. Rationalize Ig2_*_L3Geom functors, add Sphere+Facet
      1. Add some data so that Hertz-Mindlin will work with L3Geom     2. Automatically compute "mass" of cell in PeriTriaxController, if not setFocus     3. Fix auto-plotting of energies in case the simulation is reloaded     4. Fix middle-click on attributes in inspector
      1. set color_cycle in matplotlib only when it is supported (fixes test failure)
      1. Fix i386 (?) live plot issue
      1. Add function checking argument types inside FUNCTOR1D and FUNCTOR2D (requires to include full dispatched type definition in headers)     2. Reorganize the integrator so that its logic is understandable. Functionality not changed.     3. Move most clump code from integrator to clump methods     4. Automtically used InsertionSortCollider::verletDist if possible (used to be sweepLength)     5. Add --refresh param to batch, controlling refresh rate of web summary, logs etc (30s by default)     6. Fix gnuplot export with callable data specifiers     7. Put BodyCallback in #ifdef, since buggy; will be removed shortly, unless gets fixed.     8. Fix unbalanced force computation for clumps.     9. Remove accel and angAccel from state, since it is only used locally in the integrator.
      Add missing includes, thanks to Klaus for reporting.
      1. Better integration of NewtonIntegrator into Clump, avoiding linking cycle with chunkSize=1
      1. Fix State.rot() mistake (was returning displacement instead)     2. Add qt.SnapshoeEngine.plot for adding snapshot name to plot.imgData automatically     3. Add plot.savePlotSequence for making movies with plots     4. Rename utils.makeVideo bps to kbps (is really kb/s, not b/s)     5. Rename OpenGLRenderer.displayGhosts to ghosts (shorter, sufficient -- sorry, Bruno)
      Fix cache line size in OpenMPArrayAccumulator
      1. Unbreak the periodic cell.
      Add the dresden course to sphinx docs.
      1. Add a more straightforward SpherePack.ParticleSD2 method, adjust the tutorial
      1. Add scene flags about local coordinate systems and force sign convention (not yet used)     2. Fix many things around L3Geom (most importantly, re-normalization was never done, resulting in instabilities), merge code for different particle shapes in a general function handleSpheresLikeContact     3. Fix incorrect import of gts surface due to LC_NUMERIC     4. Add OpenGL-related stuff to yade-support, which might fix linking issues with natty     5. Move Cell::invTrsf and Cell::refSize to private part, so that it
      1. Make yade and yade-batch run single-threaded simulations     2. Add warning when specifying -j/--threads/--cores when lacking OpenMP support
      1. Change Cell behavior as explained on the list -- trsf can be changed freely, without side-effects; assigning refSize is deprecated (use new O.cell.setBox(...) function for that)     2. SpherePack.toSimulation sets identity transformation, but rotated hSize (if requested)     3. PeriTriaxController uses norms of hSize columns (with inverse transformaiton) as reference lengths ;; TODO (?): it should check that hSize is diagonal, otherwise it will probably behave erroneously
      1. Revert some "cleanups" in Cell (LOL, Bruno, we are overwriting each other's work again :-))     2. Add some regression tests of PBC     3. Make plot.addData aceept vectors and matrices, creating columns for individual components     4. Make compilation of SpherePadder only optional (feature sphere-padder)
      1. Add plot.autoAddData with docs. A limitation is that "=" should not be in names of data columns anymore.     2. Add Strong/weak fabric distinction to Gl1_NormPhys (not tested)     3. Degrade VelocityBin's initialization message to debug     4. Add .items() method to EnergyTracker, for fast conversion to list of tuples.
      1. Fix plots with line specifiers     2. Fix peri-triax example (sweepDist->verletDist)
      1. An attempt to fix OpenMPArrayAccumulator initialization (not tested)
      1. Update affiliation
      1. Fix OpenMPArrayAccumulator initial zeroing, re-enable plot test     2. Add Matrix3 ctor from Quaternion and vice versa in Python     3. Fix some bugs in L3Geom initial axes orientation     4. Plots now display pointed triangles instead of circles to mark current position (and orientation); plot part after the current point is transparent
      Nicer fix for 721107 (should work)
      oops, sorry
      1. Invalidate persistent collider data when interactions are cleared (not tested yet)     2. Add renderer pointer to scene, so that functors can find display attributes     3. Gl1_NormPhys honors displacement scaling now     4. Fix scalarOnColorScale bug     5. Add RadialForceEngine, fix AxialGravityEngine
      fix error in last commit

Bruno Chareyre (45):
      Local sphinx build : I made it! :)     Fixing the command in readme.
      - give path more clearly, the previous commit was assuming same relative path as mine.
      revert yade path
      - Add files for kdev4.
      - Fix ambiguities in contact geometry and time-step parts.
      - Add stress getter and python wrapper (replacing reverted r2314).
      - Add definition of work input from boundaries (resp. macro strain) in TriaxialStressController (resp. PeriTriaxController).
      - Remove useless spheresVolume (redundant with  TriaxialStressController::spheresVolume)
      - Some cleaning in ScGeom.     - Implement precomputed quantities (#define IGCACHE for compiling them).     - Experiment precomputation with ElasticContactLaw (#ifdef IGCACHE), other laws should not be impacted yet whatever IGCACHE.     - Make authors consistent (Galizzi never touched ElasticContactLaw).
      - Remove some debugging/commented code left in 2336, sorry.     - Update authors again (forgot to "save" before commit...)
      - More changes in stability section. (we need PFC manual in bibtex references...)
      - More small fixes.
      - miniEigen : memory leak source suspected (FIXME added)     - ScGeom : #define IGCACHE by default, and keep behaviour unchanged for older functions (still some cleaning to do in this class, after all Law2's have been adapted).     - CohFrictLaw : Eigen is returning nan quaternions after trivial operations, it is workarounded in the law.     - cylinder : a new shape, first step in experiments for  tracking interactions jumping over chained elements.     - utils.py : a demo script for chained cylinders
      - make the example more fun.
      - Revert last doc change and fix the original. (please don't modify documentation if you are not sure. I can't double-check all commits.)
      - Implement the distinction between node orientation (integrated in Newton) and beam orientation (always oriented as line between adjacent node). It fixes the starcases appearing in display for large stretch.
      - Fix path to fulltext.
      - restore Gl1_ChainedCylinder     - kdev4 : I failoed to commit this file apparently.
      - Cylinder, update contact point consistently with current segment definition.     - Fix the poisson=0 case (was returning undefined Ks for division by 0...)     - This commit enables wire-like behaviour without moment when ks=0
      - Last change in contact plane makes script unstable. Restore stable (but wrong?...) equations.
      - Cylinder : fix segment orientation, use correct contact point, and clean code.     - ScGeom : last step before removing old code, some functors adapted (others are using even older duplicated code apparently)     - Small sphinx fixes.
      - Use precomputed geometry everywhere in functors and remove older code.     - Make Dem3DofGeom inherit from ScGeom rather than GenericSphereContact and remove (comment) the latest.
      - Missing in last commit sorry.
      - Revert r2365 as a whole (and r2367).     - All changes in ScGeom and related functors will be commited again when I have time.
      - restore virgin yade.kdev4 and add kdev files to bzrignore.
      - publications update.
      Restore the part of r2367 concerning ScGeom (+ some more improvments).
      - restore project file for kdevelop3.
      -Update functor->momentLaw in the global engine.
      - More documention in the 2 constitutive laws.     - Some code cleaning and test redundancy fix in CohFrictPhys.cpp+CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw.cpp.
      - adds references cited in the previous commit.
      - Include a comment on "welltestedness" of ElasticContactLaw.
      - rename classes :     	Law2_ScGeom_CohFrictPhys_ElasticPlastic ->  Law2_ScGeom_CohFrictPhys_CohesionMoment     	Law2_Dem3DofGeom_FrictPhys_Basic -> Law2_Dem3DofGeom_FrictPhys_CundallStrack     	Law2_ScGeom_FrictPhys_Basic -> Law2_ScGeom_FrictPhys_CundallStrack
      - remove useless attributes,     - fix class name in TTest.
      - Add new IG class ScGeom6D precomputing relative rotations, and associated Ig functors.     - Update related classes (CFLaw)     - add kdev4 configuration for starting debug from kdevelop
      -Includes a regression test on dynamic beam flexion.
      -Move cohesion and moment parameters from functors to bodies and interactions, and define them in Ip2_2xCohFrictMat_...
      - Fix cylinder reg. test with respect to r2509(2510).     - Add output for nan quaternion products #ifdef Q_DEBUG.     - Document some flags in Ip2_2xCohFrictMat_CohFrictPhys.hpp.
      - more debug info for quaternions with nan angle.
      - Convert ScGeom to ScGeom6D in Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom6D::go(), using ScGeom::operator=     - Optimize distance check for existing interactions in Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom::go()     - Implement Ig2_Box_Sphere_ScGeom6D (same conversion to ScGeom6D)     - Adapt CohesiveTriaxialTest.
      - Fix a typo (and test some launchpad+bazar logging feature...)
      - Add python wrapping for python use of TesselationWrapper (+ a few fixes and formating)
      - add example commands in docstring.
      - Remove scene pointer from TW function parameters     - sphere-cylinder Ig2 functor (some old uncommited code - still bugged)
      - TW : really check if body geometry is sphere in the insertion loop (instead of isDynamic).     - FE : use the faster insert(begin,end) from TW for triangulation, and move area/volume definition to addBoundary().

Chiara Modenese (22):
      1) Add contact damping into HM law. 2) Add functions getIncidentVel (both for periodic and non-periodic case) and rotateShear to ScGeom. 3) Add py script to demonstrate and test the effect of contact damping.
      Rename rotateShear() to rotate() in ScGeom.
      1. Add Engine::dead attribute; if set, the engine will not be run at all (unless explicitly called via () from python or ::action from c++). Useful for temporarily (de)activating engines without having to modify O.engines     2. PeriodicPythonRunner renamed to PyRunner as it is used so often.     3. Add Cell.getVolume() and utils.porosity     4. Check for force&torque NaNs in NewtonIntegrator in debug builds     5. Add --rebuild option which will launch scons before running the simulation itself     6. Some fixes in the HertzMindlin law     7. The qt4 interface will try to open packaged docs, then docs in the source dir and online docs as the last resort.     8. Some fixes in PeriTriaxController (the servo-mechanism) and probably a bug fix in TriaxialStressController (will ask Bruno on the list to confirm the correctness)
      1. Add an alternative implementation of PSD-based particle generation; likely to be merged to makeCloud in the future
      (micro-fix for a spurious startup message)
      1. Improved summary http page for yade-multi, includes (clickable) plots and hyperlink to the log (with auth cookie removed)     2. Deprecate PartialEngine::subsribedBodies in favor of ids     3. Remove triangulation lib from ctags dirs (so that tag Facet goes to yade::Facet)     4. The qt controller computes simulation speed locally now     5. Fixes in Hertz-Mindlin     6. Add an alternative SpherePack::particleSD function     7. Make axis labels, highlighted axes etc settable in yade.plot     8. Add yade.plot.saveDataTxt     9. Fix plot names with spaces (so that multiple plots with the same x-axis can be specified)
      1. The mindlin law now prevents granular ratcheting by default.     2. Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom has now avoidGranularRatcheting bool (true by default, which was the hardcoded value till now as well); add documentation from the source to the real doc, add a few references on that.     3. SpherePack no longer saves vectors as tuples; this also fixes memoization issues with pack.random{Dense,Peri}Pack     4. Add Law2_ScGeom_MindlinPhys_HertzWithLinearShear used for testing differences between linear and non-linear law.
      (Antons changes)     1. angleRange parameter is added to facetCylinder to create "semi-cylinders", "quarter-cylinders" etc.     2. Prepare Sconstruct for compiling in Fedora (partly)
      1. Rename yade-multi to yade-batch; documentation updated     2. Make batch save plots when all jobs are done     3. Add tags d.id and id.d (description and id put together)
      1. Re-apply removal of Mathr, sorry Anton, the fault was local.
      1. Avoid adding useless lines of nans in plot for unknown variables, add only their column instead     2. Save job figure as soon as the job finishes in the batch     3. Fi O.tags['id.d'] and O.tags['d.id'] tag order
      1. Make batch commands clickable; fix encoding issues when the batch page sends job script/table     2. add utils.maxOverlapRatio for sphere-sphere contacts     3. add reinitialization counter to InsertionSortCollider     4. Add VTKRecorder.ascii so that saved XML data might be human-readable (false by default)
      1. Resurrect SnapshotEngine     2. Add Gl1_NormPhys for displaying interaction network (http://beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/temp/Gl1_NormPhys.avi)     3. Make VTKRecroder work nicely with periodic boundary conditions (repeating interaction on both sides if it crosses the cell boundary using a few hacks)     4. Add Shop::normalShearStressTensors for computing (once more) stress tensor, but normal and shear contributions separately     5. Allow specify particle counts for SpherePack.particleSD     6. utils.makeVideo now uses mencoder (and works, unlike the older gstreamer-based thing, which would not work anymore)     7. Add Matrix3.diagonal()     8. Integrate regression tests suite in the main program (yade --test)     9. Set plot.scientific==True only if the version of pylab installed supports it (thanks to Anton for reporting)
      1. Add scripts/test/force-network-video.py     2. Rename attribute flags (Attr::readonly, Attr::triggerPostLoad etc)     3. Detect whether display is available and store it in yade.runtime.hasDisplay (false by default); that restores the behavior of yade.qt, which raises ImportError at no display, and makes yade.plot consistent with tha variable as well     4. Fix total running time for batches     5. Do not send 0 refresh for finished job files (refreshes as frequently as possible, whereas no refresh was desired)     6. Debian package depends on mencoder now     7. qt.SnapshotEngine open the view automatically if needed (not very reliable, though)     8. Add scripts/test/force-network-video.py     9. Fixes in the OpenGLRenderer that avoid crashes; drawWithNames should draw shapes in the same place as draw witout names, making the selection consistent with what is seen (periodic boundaries etc)     10. Move {ScGeom,Dem3DofGeom}::contactPoint to GenericSpheresContact     11. Initial (not yet functional) implementation of the partial slip solution for Hertz-Mindlin (Mindlin-Deresiewitz)
      1. Introduce a class for returning or computing scalar values based on combination of 2 ids. [experimental, don't use or ask questions about it now]
      1. Rename InteractionDispatchers to InteractionLoop; backwards-compat for python as usual, typedef with deprecated warning in c++; update all scripts and docs to reflect that.     2. Add NozzleFactory, which might be in the future generalized to a generic factory object and a numebr of derived classes with different parameters (such as factory area shape, specification of sphere parameters etc); see scripts/test/shots.py     3. Fix many crashers in the OpenGL code; unbreak particle selection     4. Finalize the MatchMaker class, with convertor from python floats to specify fixed value.     5. MatchMaker is used to specify different coefficients of restitution for different material couples in Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_MindlinPhys; viscous constants moved away from Law2_ScGeom_MindlinPhys_Mindlin into MindlinPhys instead.     6. Fix compilation errors caused by unintelligedn 3rd-party Combine builder to scons -- save sombined files to an external file, force refresh of all combined files if the md5 changes. Does not increase compilation time.     7. Add DomainLimiter engine for deleting particles that go ouside some domain (see scripts/test/shots.py)     8. Add DragForceApplier (not yet tested); thans to Stefano for the suggestion.
      1. Add #pragma once to MatchMaker (thanks, Remi)     2. Remove a few useless scripts.
      1. Make the debug build installed in the same directory as the release build; it is compiled with debug=1 (or True); there is only a single yade executable for both, and the debug plugins are loaded with --debug. I tried to adjust packaging rules a bit, I hope it will not introduce additional errors. --debug and --rebuild work fine together.     2. Add --debug option to yade-batch, which runs yade with --debug.
      1. Add LawTester class for prescribing displacements on interactions precisely, see scripts/test/law-test.py     2. plot now displays the last point as a bullet     3. Rename Interaction{Geometry,Physics} to I{Geom,Phys}; rename related classes as well (functors etc)     4. Rename Interaction::interaction{Geometry,Physics} to Interaction::{geom,phys}     5. Add Vector3.normalized() to the eigen wrapper     6. Add framework for arbitrary rendering hooks (GLDrawExtra) run from OpenGLRenderer at the end of the rendering routine (not yet fully tested)
      1. Do not return Attr::hidden attributes in dict(); that makes them invisible in the UI as well.
      1. Fix batch script with debug builds, thanks to Anton for reporting.
      1. Fix a few malformed formulas (my bad) so that LaTeX does not choke on them.

      Minor documentation fixes.
      1. Split publications in articles, conferences, theses     2. Fix problem with scons 2.0, now it works out of the box     3. Add a better error message for VelocityBins with NaN velocity
      1. Add show Paraview documentation to the postprocessing section     2. Fix at least partially the rotated cell bug in shift2 (https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/601866), still some issues elsewhere, though.
      1. Fix stale potential interactions -- we've been dragging this bug since april, I will backport it to 0.50. You are strongly recommended to update!!! The bug was, in the end, not in the collider, but in the container; it had <= instead of >= in one condition. Sorry.
      Fix Facet AABB computation in periodic scenes (another important update!)
      1. LIVE PLOTTING (thanks to Janek for the idea and the suggestion of mtTkinter). Report bugs.
      1. Fix InteractionGeometryDispatcher (in case someone still uses it).
      1. Move triaxial documentation from the wiki to sphinx
      1. Make utils.saveVars, utils.loadVars and utils.readParamsFromTable synthesize modules in yade.params.* to avoid name clashes in builtins (see docs and user's manual, you have to adapt your code if you use those)     2. Rewrite the installation page in sphinx (sorry, Anton, I hope it is a little more readable now)     3. Fix several undefined xrefs in the docs.     4. Disable wm3-compatibility in eigen wrapper (Vector3.UNIT_X etc)     5. Rename utils.chCylinder to utils.chainedCylinder, update docs there (sorry, Bruno, but chCylinder is really not a self-explanatory name)
      1. Fix dispatch-torture scripts/test/dispatcher-torture.py     2. Remove wm3-compat code     3. Escape \d in the doc (must be \\d in c literals)
      1. Make GL dispatchers proper classes exposed to python     2. Make State and derived classes indexable     3. Update scripts/test/dispatcher-torture.py
      1. Fix compilation error due to free-standing function out (remember: NO FREE FUNCTIONS, everything must be inside classes, otherwise there is the risk of name clashes.)
      1. Fix the GL dispatch (was enumerating child classes non-recursively, and your Gl1_ChainedCylinder did not inherit directly from GlShapeFunctor)     2. Do not use '|||' to separate plot axes, use None instead (||| is deprecated)     3. Move the Gl1_ChainedCylinder functor inside #ifdef YADE_OPENGL (please pay attention to that)
      1. Add noqt3 feature (still keeps OpenGL available), run qt4 app at the beginning (emits warning)     2. Make GLUtils independent of QGLViewer     3. Add some metadata to attribute docstrings     4. Add scripts to render scene to pyQGLViewer and to show basic serialization interface in PyQt4.     5. Make static attributes non-static in python (enables docstrings)
      1. Make static attributes documented (xrefs still not working, though)     2. Add section on the Material-State association to the Programmer's manual     3. Fix syntax error in qt4-attributes.py
      Fix docs
      1. Do not uselessly pass Scene* pointer to Law2 functors (already in LawFunctor)     2. Attempt at Law2_ScGeom_CpmPhys_Cpm (not tested)
      1. Add the possibility of custom constructors to python (not a hack as it used to be)     2. Add cached functors to explicitly created interactions (not saved, though)     3. Improve the ScGeom-based Cpm law     4. Change interface of StepDisplacer to specify mov and rot separately (old interface with deltaSe3 works, but warns)     5. Add scripts/test/cpm-dem3dof-scgeom.py to show some differences between the 2 geometry formulations.
      1. Turn many fatal warnings in UniaxialStrainer to exceptions, remove some guess-logic     2. Automatically disable live plots in batches.     3. the concrete uniaxial test now has the scGeom switch
      1. Some VTK recorder fixes.     2. cpm fixes (untested)
      1. Save interaction as vtkPolyData rather than vtkUnstructuredGrid (to allow the Tube filter to operate on it).
      1. add noShow to uytils.plotDirections     2. Some fixes for ScGeom+Cpm (still problematic)
      1. Preliminary version of PyQt4 interface (3d viewer flickers, reason unknown). Config checks largely absent.
      1. Remove linkStrategy option. Specifying chunkSize=1 provides the per-plugin linkage.     2. Add qt4 feature, which conflicts qt3. Qt3 must be now explicitly defined. QT4DIR must be defined (defaults to /usr/share/qt4, which works for debian)     3. Add checks for python modules and prettify boost checks.     4. Remove a lot of legacy code, so that the qt4 build avoids yade::serialization completely     5. Add live inspection and modification of arbitrary sequences, for a showcase see the Inspect button on the simulation tab (Body/Interaction inspection will be rather easy as well)     6. Add common handling of number arrays (Vector3, Matrix3, Quaternion)     7. Add to-python converters for vector<vector<string>> and list<string> (only needed in Dispatchers, avoids tome exceptions)     8. Rename OpenGLRenderingEngine to OpenGLRenderer
      Path hotfix.
      1. Dispatchers cleanup (will continue)
      1. Remake inheritance tree for Dispatchers, so that functors are really of the right type. Involves some macro ugliness.     2. Add rudimentary (but working) inspection interface for engines, bodies, interactions     3. Fix compilation without qt3 (will be removed soon, completely)
      (forgotten file)
      1. Make types and attributes in all editors clickable     2. Add editor for Se3, Vector3i, Vector2, Vector2i     3. Fix bugs in eigen's wrapper for Vector2i and Vector3i
      1. Fix static properties of Eigen objects (return values, not references - see http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-users@lists.launchpad.net/msg02339.html)
      1. SpherePack.makeCloud can distribute grains based on their mass (rather than count) along arbitrary PSD or uniformly if rMean is given (the default behavior is unchanged)     2. SpherePack.psd() function for generating particle size distribution, either based on particle count or their volume (mass)     3. A few fixes in the UI     4. Fix facet "coincident vertices" warning
      1. Add script demonstrating mass-based and size-based particle size distributions (PSD) and how to specify and arbitrary function for PSD when generating random loose packing with SpherePack.makeCloud
      1. Disable (experimental and malfunctioning) multiblock files with vtk<5.2 (did not exist)
      1. Remove qt3 interface     2. Remove yade::serialization and related otherwise useless files     3. Remove lib/loki, use the official Loki library (in /usr/include/loki, package libloki-dev) instead, except for (highly incompatible) Singleton, which was moved to lib/base.
      merge noqt3 branch
      1. Body flags instead of bools + isBounded/setBounded flag.     2. Move body_id_t to Body.hpp
      1. Change body_id_t to Body::id_t     2. Assign Body.bounded in py/utils.py funcs (in prep for making BoundDispatcher 1d)
      1. Make Bo1 functors really 1D     2. add Body::isBounded/setBounded so that there is a way to ask for a body to not have bound created by BoundDispatcher     3. Change bool Body::dynamic into a bit inside Body::flags     4. Change body_id_t to Body::id_t since boost::serialization can handle class-defined types gracefully
      1. Integrate BoundDispatcher into Collider, its python ctor takes list of BoundFunctors now     2. Warning and help if BoundDispatcher is used directly (more precisely: if Collider has no BoundFunctors defined and there is BoundDispatcher in O.engines)     3. Remove Body(id,mask) ctor as it bypasses default value initializers     4. Adjust preprocessors to the previous item
      1. Remove BoundDispatcher from O.engines in examples, scripts and sphinx (accidental typos possible, sorry)
      1. Remove outputFilename from FileGenerator, pass that as argument directly; remove message as FileGenerator's member; FileGenerator is no longer ThreadWorker (was not used)     2. Remove all variables named 'rootBody' in generators
      (detail: make SeqSerializable number nicer)
      1. Rename some stuff in Omega and Scene to make it consistent with python:     Scene::currentIteration->Scene::iter     Scene::getSimulationTime()->Scene::time     Scene::getComputation...Time()->Scene::getComputationTime()     Scene::stopAtIteration->Scene::stopAtIter     etc.     2. Fix bug with per-class compilation (thanks to Sega for reporting)
      1. Adjust docs for changes in the last commit     2. Add version requirement for python-sphinx to debian/control-template (Anton: that's the reason why the build fails in maverick; I uploaded 1.0~hg... into yade-users/external so it should build fine in a few hours; there is no use uploading 0.6 which is in maverick already)
      1. replace {pre,post}ProcessAttributes by {pre,post}{Save,Load} (not virtual)     2. change attribute specification adding and additional attribute flags (read-only from python, not saved, should call postLoad after changing value from python)     3. Macros cleanup in Serializable     4. Support clang for compilation (more than 2x faster) https://yade-dem.org/wiki/Compilation_with_LLVM/clang     (documentation not yet update to reflect those changes fully, sorry)
      1. Add sub-stepping functionality (step by engines rather than by whole iterations)     2. Expose Scene in python properly (not very well tested yet...)     3. Update documentation about attribute flags     4. Remove some 3rd party files no longer needed
      1. Add foce, torque etc display in the body tab of the inspector     2. Make force, torque etc access from python not require thread synchronization (sums up threads on demand)
      1. When disabling sub-stepping when the last step is done only partially, all remaining substeps are run at the next step.
      1. Fix bugs related to 3d views (centering, secondary views, closing views). Thanks to Sega for reporting.
      1. Consistently use SUFFIX for what is the same for debug and non-debug version, and libDir for plugin installation directory. Hopefully that cleans the mess we've had. That should also fix startup problems with --debug that Anton reported     2. Do not #define PREFIX and SUFFIX as macros, since they are not used in the c++ code anymore (and should not be)
      1. Link to the standard libstdc++.so.6 (which is instaleld everywhere) instead of libstdc++.so, which is only in the devel package of gcc     2. Full support for compilation with clang (packaged for lucid and maverick now), as explained at https://www.yade-dem.org/wiki/Compilation_with_LLVM/clang#Building_yade (openmp and optimizations do not work)     3. Add function to ScGeom to compute incident velocity from python.
      1. Fix QT4CXX key error, thanks to Anton for reporting.
      1. Fix startup error with debug-only builds. Sorry, Anton.
      1. Enhance the gl-drawer for LawTester.
      1. Fix both rotation and shear in LawTester. Signs are now consistent are correspond to displacements as defined on classical beam (x is the axis, y and z are in the shear plane)
      1. Clear erro message when running debug-only build without --debug
      1. Make number in qt4 show the left-most part if the text field is narrower, rather than the left part     2. Run the debug version if optimized is not available, even without --debug     3. Add the possibility of running the monolithig compilation (mono=True); not fully functional yet.     4. Add warning when using march with clang, which leads to crashes (optimizations are not the cause, in the end)
      1. Flattening the file hierarchy, as mentioned previously. No changes to #include paths so far.     2. Change the directory where to install headers to not include yade version
      1. Add OpenGLRenderer to DomainLimiter, that should fix the linking issue reported by Janek.
      1. Fix debian linkage with MatchMaker (hopefully)     2. Add preliminary and experimental L3Geom class (do not use, do not ask etc -- yet).
      1. Make forgotten class members public (sorry, Anton)
      1. Enhance LawTester to work with L3Geom, fix some bugs     2. Add uN and uT references inside L3Geom, for respective components of the deformation vector
      1. Add Vector6r wrapper (both c++ and python)     2. Fix prefix bug in initialization braking debian packages     3. Fix renames in py/test which made regression tests fail     4. Update LawTester and L3Geom for 6 dofs (not yet tested, please do not use now)
      1. Add menu entry for the dbg package (yes, it really does not show up, dunno why either)     2. Add plasticity to Law2_L3Geom_FrictPhys_ElPerfPl, add convenience function to apply local forces
      1. Clean up Vector6 and friends     2. Create Matrix_computeUnitaryPositive template to be compat between eigen2 and eigen3 (in the future)
      1. undefine pi in MindlinPhys     2. Add isAspherical() flag to Body     3. Adjust kineticEnergy with PBC (not yet fully tested)     4. Make createInteraction work with PBC     5. Fix getIncidentVelocity with PBC and !avoidGranularRatcheting     6. Add some regression tests related to Cell (not yet fully done)
      1. syntax hotfix for batch -- thanks, Ema.
      1. Fix kinetic energy in PBC     2. Add tests to check PBC: Ek, incident velocity with ScGeom (with and without ratcheting), homothetic resize     3. Make it possible to set O.dt=0, for reasons of testing.
      1. Deprecate NewtonIntegrator::homotheticCellResize in favor of Cell::homoDeform (compatibility interface with warning)     2. Add the possibility of homothetically changing positions rather than velocities; avoid the meanfield/fluctuation velocity jazz at the expense of vel not being time derivative of pos     3. Add PBC tests for the previous variant     4. Add defThreads arg to scons, which, if specified, gives default number of threads for simulations, if not overridden with -j     5. Fix a few example scripts, more work ahead come (please help!)     6. Add regression tests for saving/loading yade objects; on maverick, this makes the unregistered class to re-surface (!!)
      1. Update the dispatch-torture script.
      1. Fix laoding of unitialized LawTester
      1. Disable debug messages from ScGeom in both debug and non-debug (!!) builds
      1. Fix boost::sertialization class export (changed slightly in boost 1.42, which broke our case); that also solves the issues at maverick     2. Add framework for tracking energies (will be documented at some point), added to Law2_ScGeom_FrictPhys_CundallStrack, see scripts/test/energy.py     3. Convert energy trackers in Hertz-Mindlin to OpenMPAccumulator     4. Make OpenMPAccumulator align storage so that each thread uses one cache line (should be faster)     5. Make OpenMPAccumulator not require zero value pointer (is handled via ZeroInitializer template in lib/base/Math.hpp     6. Make OpenMPAccumulator work transparently with python (it can be used as a regular attribute now), make it boost::serializable as well; it appears transparently as a number in python.     7. Add OpenMPArrayAccumulator, for linear array of values (used in EnergyTracker)     8. Make deprecated attributes with non-g++ compilers (clang); previously, only g++>=4.3 was supported     9. Fix a few example script (not completed)
      1. (hopefully) fix build with boost::serialization<1.42 broken by previous commit.
      1. Add warning for missing ForceResetter in NewtonIntegrator (based step forces were last reset)     2. Rename *Spiral*  to *Helix* (suggested by Jan, thanks!)     3. Generalize the post2d module to handle interactions (not just particles)
      1. Fix intiialization problem in Shop::kineticEnergy (thanks, Anton)     2. Several enhancements of the post2d module     3. Fix a few crashers with deleted particles.     4. Improve utils.facetCylinder
      1. Add HdapsGravityEngine which reads acceleration from real accelerometer in thinkpads (toy engine)     2. Fix bug in qt4 interface where multi-number entries (Vector3r etc) might have some values zeroed due to wrong order of initial update and signal connects.
      1. Make clumps subclass of Shape (instead of Body)     2. Favicon in the batch web interface     3. Fix for clang compilation
      1. Fix examples, delete a few other ones     2. Fix a bug in post2d

      VTKRecorder changes:     1. clumpIds recorder changed to clumpId     2. materialID recorder changed to materialId     3. ids recorder changed to id     4. Syntax cleaning     5. Default parameter 'all' is added
      subscribedBodies parameter is added to VTKRecorder
      Some fixes in VTKRecorder
      1. Parameter groupMask is added to utils.sphere and utils.facet     2. VTKRecorder. subscribedBodies mechanism was changed to
      VtkRecorder changes:     1. Velocities of particles are now exported as Vector3 and Length component separately.     2. Added 'force' parameter for facets and spheres (sorry, not good tested yet)
      Force calculation mechanism is changed in VTKRecorder (Thanks to Vaclav). Experimental.
      VTKRecorder. force->stress. But only for Dem3DofGeom now
      1. Some warnings were commented (please, don't leave unused variables!)     2. In Shop created getStressForEachBody method to clean up VTKRecorder a little bit (not tested yet, but compiles)

      Removed BasicPM.cpp and added CundallStrack.cpp. It is a duplication of Law2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_Elastic but written in meta style like RockPM.  It is therefore cleaner and more friendly to a beginner.

      Cohesionless Moment Rotation LLaw as implemented by Plassiard et al (2009).  Verified
      changed Cohesionless Rotation Law to be cleaner
      added instructions on how to use ContactLaw with TriaxialTest

Bruno Chareyre (102):
      A flag "neverErase" is added to the contact law to define if it can     erase interactions. This flag can be turned on when another constitutive     law (e.g. capillaryCohesiveLaw) is in charge of erasing interactions.
      - fix wrong usage of "neverErase" in TTWater     - synchronise versions of ECLaw
      Fix the path in the warning.
      Please, never make me do that again!!
      A (little) bit of cleaning.
      Fix warnings.
      And one more back.
      - fix segfault in test.cpp (testing the triangulation functions)     - adapt the collider to state/material
      State/Mat fix.
      Fixed : 2 "unused variable" warnings.
      - fix the bug on bodies type in CFTriaxialTest     - rename CohesiveFrictionalBodyParameters => CohesiveFrictionalMat     - fix the bias in cloud generation (try and position a sphere of constant radius)     - some more cleanup of the code
      - update of the documentation
      Add the missing #include AABB
      Code using the velocity gradient to define periodic deformations (experimental) + script to test it.     Needs compilation with #defined VELGRAD (currently needs uncommenting "#define VELGRAD" in 4 files in total).
      Fix some warnings.
      -Restore default behaviour even with #define VELGRAD, restore default homotheticCellResize=0 and register it. All py scripts should work whatever VELGRAD, except     periodic-triax-velgrad.py (throw without VELGRAD for homotheticCellResize=1).     -Clean code     -Fix mail adress E.C.
      Make non-proportional scripts really work with VELGRAD :     -Update Hsize when refsize is modified once (this is ugly! needs a cleaner way)     -Adapt size control by periodic engines.     Sorry for this new change in Cell.h. It will not change for a while now, next commits will be in engines.
      Add a new periodic compressor engine (candidate for replacing/merging with PeriTriaxController). Most important changes :     - stress control using mass     - defines the full stress tensor (not only normal stress for each axis)     - defines strain with logarithm for comparison with goals and postprocessings
      - merge stiffness/inertia control in PeriTriaxEngine and remove periEngine     - show usage of inertia (commented out) in py script
      A funny script, and no crash!
      -Fix the loading path, this example shows how shear create rotations.
      -A commented suggestion for dispatchers     -Get back r1932 in PIC     -Fix a wrong assignment of max vels in StressController that was causing non-isotropic compression (introduced a while ago when Luc Si. implemented 3D independant     controls probably)
      Optional porosity in makeCloud, giving a value discards rMean (avoid guessing rMean when you know size and number).
      -Fix messed comment (save before commit!).
      Comments.
      - Rename Poison -> KsOnKn in some preprocessors. Not project-wide : I don't know what laws are used in PHYSPAR'ed files.     - some cleaning in TT code
      - Add CGAL excpetion in GNU GPL license.
      rename KsOnKn -> KsDivKn.
      Revert weird changes from JFJ in TWrapper interface (min/max should not be mandatory in any functions!).
      I managed to remove the variable while adding the comment. Glad nobody noticed yet...
      - Remove old files
      - add insert(Scene& scene) to tesselation wrapper (faster)     - move TWrapper out of namespace CGT and make it a YADE plugin     - move TWrapper sources to pkd-dem/globalEngine, keep different (uncompiled) versions in lib for possible out of tree builds     - some more documentation in TWrapper.hpp
      - missing files in previous commit     - fix a member's name in TW
      - Fix : old names used in #includes and code
      - Add a function KLA::DefToFile() writing the triangulation and deformations to a file     - Use it in MMAnalyser.
      - Fix read/write details in TriaxialState and few other small fixes     - MMA is now fully operational for strain maps
      - switch some spaces/endlines
      Fix compile errors in VTKWritter and KLA.
      - Fix size range in makeCloud. It was generating an interval twice smaller than expected.
      Update the documentation. Used with uniform distribution, makeCloud now generates radii between mean-rRelFuzz and mean+rRelFuzz.
      1. Remove lib/triangulation/TesselationWrapper. No need to keep in Yade files used only for out-of-tree builds + it was confusing to have the same file names twice.     2. Reformat vtk output.     3. Implement more methods to control the input/output of TesselationWrapper, access MicroMacroAnalyser methods via TWrapper interface, return all data in a python array     (still commented).
      1- move subdivideTriangle in the glNewList section. No reason to do that elsewhere.     2- Suggest using glList even when stripes=false (commented code) for better performance.     Both changes affected by this bug for now : https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/509084.
      - Remove the part of the code that was only a hack to display bodies with broken contacts, and remove some spaces.
      - Uncomment the line assigning deformation values in python::dict get().     - Add MATRIX3R_TO_NUMPY macro in numpy.hpp
      -Add missing members declarations (forgot to commit the header with a previous commit)
      Fix a compile error when openMP is not in features.
      - Global update of the triangulation lib.
      - Fix some compile errors.     - Re-implement arbitrary boudaries ids.     - Generalize boundary conditions.     - Clean the code.
      -disable the independant GL display.
      - Fix compile errors with cgal in features.
      - Fix compile error (forgot this one in lastr commit)
      Flow:     - Implement bz2 read/write for TriaxialStates     - 3rd method for hydraulic force and some optimizations in FlowBS (Ema, I'll let you remove unused code)     - new data in cell_info
      - Mostly some formatting.     - Compute the new tesselation in Interpolate().
      - remove files not used in yade.
      - Comment the includes pointing to out of tree files to prevent compile errors with implicit link.
      - Fix the bug (r2025 probably) in GSTimeStepper (test of line 28).     - Register timeSteppers.     - numpy : comment and new line at EOF     - TW : fix a warning.     - PTCollider : remove a "using namespace std" in the header.
      Some changes in the TCE behaviour. Save the state before stopping simulation, and start compression for reloaded files with autoCompression=true.     Please keep intact the behaviour even when the code looks strange, there are reasons behind. I ran 1 week simulations, expecting     saved xml at the end, but got nothing... I've included a fews comments about this.
      - A few more comments and code cleaning.
      - Fix an error in max_vel's definition.
      - Register attributes of the stress controller and of derived classes.     - Make them "global" engines instead of "partial" (and replace "applyCondition" by "action")     - Add a function computing the solid volume of a sphere packing in Shop.
      - py wrapping for getSpheresVolume (usage : O.getSpheresVolume)
      - Missing in previous commit and creating compile error, sorry for that.
      - Some documentation and code cleaning.
      - Fix syntax error + small changes in the documentation.
      Fix compile error ifndef YADE_OPENPM.
      -Register and code cleaning.
      -Link to the wiki page for general instructions and files download.
      -One more initialisation in ctor (strain).
      - Fix : wrong assignnment of friction for boxes. compactFrictionDeg was used in place of boxFrictionDegree. No idea when     it was introduced.
      - Register TriaxialTest (yes!!).
      - Remove useless transition returning a LOG_ERROR.
      - More registering!
      - Remove unused unregistered engine.
      - Register, rename, clean code, doccument some attributes.
      - New names in Attic files (follow-up of r2156, more to come).
      - Add a "cohesiveFrictional" functor for usage in interaction dispatching (functionally replace the global engine CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw, which is still here and     used in cohesive preprocessor).     - Register "cohesiveFrictional" classes and rename them.     - Some cleaning and a fix in the law for brittle failure.
      -Use new names.
      - Some fixes in triangulation. Python array still crashing in TW.
      - Use new names.
      - Remove SCG_SCHEAR, clean code and documentation a little bit more.
      - Take "fuzz" into account for the definition of rMean in the generated distribution.
      - Update the link to capillary files.
      - Make the radius of fictious sphere equal to the one of real sphere in box-sphere geometry.     - Implement energy tracing in ElasticContactLaw     - Remove some "#ifdef SCG_SHEAR"
      - Remove equilibriumDistance and initialEquilibriumDistance from FrictPhys and inheriting code.     - Remove rotationBlocked from TriaxialTest.     - Fix documentation (backticks in pkg/dem/PreProcessor/TriaxialTest.hpp, pkg/dem/Engine/PartialEngine/TriaxialStressController.hpp,     pkg/dem/Engine/PartialEngine/TriaxialCompressionEngine.hpp).
      - Fix cohesiveFrictional crasher     - Initialise saveSImulation correctly in TCE     - Remove initialKn/Ks assignment Ip2_2xCohFrictMat_CohFrictPhys
      - Put back Vector3r::Zero()
      py wrapping for shop::getSpheresVolume(). Used e.g. for computing porosity in a periodic cell.
      - Use Shop::kineticEnergy in the recorder (adds the rotational term).
      - Fix strainRate comparisons for the case dynCell=true.     - Simplify the code, removing cellGrow totaly and using gradVel everywhere instead (its time derivative).     - Rmk : I suspect some of those changes have been commited before, then reverted, but I couldn't really spot when/why. Actually, the revert     attempt broke the "dynCell" behavior. This commit should not change anything for dynCell=false. Let me now if you see a difference.
      - Fix the distance correction in plastic slip.
      - Compile error (sorry) : matrix(i,k) instead of matrix[i][k]... (couldn't we overload simply define [][] operator for Eigen matrices?)
      - Simplify equations inside plastic condition of Dem3Dof (1 sqrt instead of 3, less norm()), add a new function that uses a multiplier instead of maxDisp to take     advantage of this new formulation (Vaclav, could you review and tell if we should merge maxDisp/multiplier in one single function with a bool? I didn't want to break any     other part so I didn't touch the previous function).     - Fix a wrong equation in shop::unbalanced force (max is for body force, not contact force).     - hardcode tensor product in PeriIso, as this is instanciating a matrix and it is done for each contact at each step.
      - Remove one more norm(), return 0 for compatibility.
      - Fix the plastic dissipation equation in ElasticContactLaw and make plasticDissipation a OpenMPaccumulator.     - Fix the name scaleDisplacementT(Real multiplier), handle the case force=0 correctly (thanks Vaclav).     - Fix mail adress.
      - Implement scaleDisplacementT(multiplier) for all functors derived from Dem3DOF. This function is only used in     Law2_Dem3DOFGeom_FrictPhys_basic at the moment.     - Fix the undefined scene pointer in ElasticContactLaw.
      - Register TTWater correctly.     - Update documentation of some classes, reformat a little, and fix (again) some email adresses.
      1 - stress definition in PeriIsoCompressor was wrong for ScGeom (sign mistake due to double-reverse);
      Missing files in r2249.
      This commit complete the implementation of periodicity for incremental formulation, with updated relative velocity across periods.     It has been tested carefully in periodic triaxial tests.     1. updateShearForce is renamed rotateAndGetShear and DOES NOT update shear force any more : this is Law2's job. Two versions are available, for resp. periodic and     non-periodic case so that people don't have to worry about the additional "shift" in function parameters.     2. put the line fs+=ks*dus in laws using the former ScGeom::updateShearForce.     3. Put back Hsize in Cell (I need that each time I write a line in periodicity, really, please don't remove it).     4. The rest is details (fix wm3 incompatibilies, formating, documentation, etc.).
      - Fix compile error, sorry.
      - Fix Wm3 build in Dem3DofGeom_FacetSphere.cpp, the Real*Vector had not     been reverted in that file.     - Workaround https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/585898.
      - Implement Cundall-style positions scaling when (homotheticCellResize=2).     - Rename Water=>Capillary (more accurate)     - Register CFTTest.

Chiara Modenese (5):
      Added constitutive law with Hertz formulation for contact stiffnesses
      Make penetrationDepth directly accessible through python
      Removing variable timeStepOutputInterval from the TT, it was useless.
      Add tangential values for the stiffnesses in HM law so that GSTS can be used (anyway contact forces are computed from the secant stiffness values to avoid numerical approximations). Avoid to store trialFs to the physics functor as it is already referenced. Correct a banal mistake in failure criterion.
      - Small changes in HM to handle PBC if scene is periodic (same logic as in ElasticContactLaw.cpp)

Emanuele Catalano (16):
      Add code for flow problem resolution.
      Updated flow engine files.
      Made some correction in flowengine files.
      - Made corrections on flow code     - Class registration via new macros introduced
      Few corrections in flow files.
      Forgot to delete some line.
      - Modified the type of some function in FlowBoundingSphere     - Adapted FlowEngine to that modifications     - Adjusted the use of "currentTes" in FlowEngine
      - Introduced timing information from engines and functors     - Reorganized the code and cleaned from useless stuff
      - Verified properly re-triangulation     - Made corrections on Gauss-Seidel break criterion     - Assigned more severe tolerance to permeability computation
      - Fixed some error due to pointer scene* deletion     - Added functions to write Mplotlib files
      - Adjustments to the code
      - Fixed retriangulation problems
      - Flow Code Maintenance     - Introduced local permeabilities' correction agent
      - Fixed retriangulation problems
      - Walls proper identification is no more ID dependent     - New output files for fluid pressure and settlement evolution     - Fixed some warning came out with new compiler version
      - Fixed errors in walls' identification

Janek Kozicki (4):
      fixes #571674
      don't segfault when TriaxialStressController is facing clumps
      Scene.hpp -> remove obsolete comment     QtGUIGenerator -> wider view on vector fields     TriaxialStateRecorder and TriaxialCompressionEngine -> it was segfaulting with clumps: fix it.
      was not compiling with wm3

Jerome Duriez (26):
      Beginning of adapting code about simple shear (to train with bzr almost)     - There are still indeed the YADE_REQUIRE_FEATURE(PHYS_PAR) lines which prevent these files to be compiled.     - There is only one change that will be detected by your news compilings : change of a line in ElasticContactLaw. I corrected a link towards an URL corresponding to "old     wiki"
      Renaming of all (normally) linked with this famous "ContactLaw1". Thanks to Vaclav for his scripts !
      Dplt de SimpleShear hors de attic
      Re-activation (suppression de YADE_REQ...(PHYS_PAR) ) de RockJointPhys, et RockJointLawRelationships
      - "SimpleShear" was re-introduced in pkg/, instead of attic/
      (Last ?) renaming of classes linked with "my" contact law. The normal inelasticity is now emphasized in the name, because it is what is specific to these classes. NB : this     contact law takes also into account a moment transfer.
      Re-writing of classes CinemCNCEngine, NormalInelastictiyLaw (and those linked : NormalInelasticityPhys and Ip2_2xCohFrictMat_NormalInelasticityPhys) according to the macros     replacing former REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES...
      Move of the line YADE_PLUGIN((...)) of CinemCNCEngine : it was before the "include...", and for Emmanuele it did not compile thus. Moved after the "include".
      Re-write of CinemKNCEngine according to new macros. Anecdotic changes in CinemCNCEngine
      Suppressing of commented lines
      Renaming of Cinem...Engine in an english way :     - CNC = Constant Normal Load => CNL     - KNC = Constant Normal Stifness => CNS     - DNC = Constant Normal Displacement => CND     - DTC = Constant Tangential Displacement => CTD
      - Correct writing of Disp2DPropLoadEngine : in order to perform tests on a shear box, piloted by dispNormal + k*dispTangential = 0     Compilation enabled by the way.     - Minor syntax changes of doc of KinemCNSEngine
      - Suppression of CinemCisEngine, which even me almost never used.     - Add of KinemCTDEngine: performs constant tangential displacement (=oedometrical) compressions on the simple shear box     - move of KinemCND from pkg/common to pkg/dem. This Engine does not use really any DEM-specific concept, but I guess it will always be used in DEM simulations, so I thought     it will be more adequate in dem/     - modify of corresponding "include"...     - rewrite of KinemCNDEngine.hpp, with "good" macros
      - Use of YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_* macro family in KinemCNDENgine (it was not in r2082, contrary to what was previously said)
      - Rename of NormalInelasticityLaw into Law2_ScGeom_NormalInelasticityPhys_NormalInelasticity (I accept sincerely any proposal of shorter file names...)     In fact it is not yet a functor, but I want to try to write it in a more proper way...     - Corresponding changes in affected files     - Details in other files
      - Rename of NormalInelasticityLaw into Law2_ScGeom_NormalInelasticityPhys_NormalInelasticity (I accept sincerely any proposal of shorter file names...)     In fact it is not yet a functor, but I want to try to write it in a more proper way...     - Corresponding changes in affected files     - Details in other files
      ANECDOTIC COMMIT     - fix typo in Engine.hpp : "fron" corrected by "from"     I commit this alone, with no other changes, to make clear to everyone that this change to a central part of Yade is really anecdotic...
      - the code concerning the inelastic normal law is now in files named NormalInelasticityLaw.* instead of Law2_ScGeom_NormalInelasticityPhys_NormalInelasticity.*     The class itself has still the same name (Law2...), but I changed the name of the files for practical reasons, as it seem other people do (files HertzMindlin,     CohesiveFrictionalPM for ex). Tell me if this is problematic
      Re-write of CohesiveFrictionalMat with YADE_BASE... macro.     It is not one of "my" files but I wanted to use it with Python, so I did it. I hope noone will be offensed.
      - Add of a script NormalInelasticityTest to test ... the NormalInelasticityLaw (Law2_ScGeom_NormalInelasticityPhys_NormalInelasticity)     Moreover my python problems I had difficulties to obtain "perfect results". I think it is linked to the way un is computed in Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom (see for     example this "shift2").     Why not making penetrationDepth directly accessible through python ??
      - Change of Law2_ScGeom_NormalInelasticityPhys_NormalInelasticity into a real functor instead of an Engine (compilation checked, and that's all)
      - Run of NormalInelasticityTest, now Law2...NormalInelasticity is a functor => same results as before it seems     - Change of .Length() in .norm() in other scripts, as .Length() seems to be deprecated
      - One more change of .Length() in .norm()     - check in NormalInelasticityTest.py that the curves are perfect !
      **** "My" files *****     - Law2_ScGeom_NormalInelasticityPhys_NormalInelasticity is now a functor as it should.     - Related changes in few files     - The script NormalInelasticityTest tests now the tangential component also, and it will normaly soon check the MomentLaw. It illustrates also the various ways of controlling disp$
      Fix of https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/589516 (sorry, the compilation did not crash on my computer when I tried)
      - Cleaning changes in NormalInelasticityFiles...             =>Add of a new Material storing the info for differences between loading and unloading (related changes)

Luc Scholtes (13):
      - correction of thickness computation in TriaxialStressController - submission of an updated version of cohesiveFrictionalContactLaw called cohesiveFrictionalPM (more details in CohesiveFrictionalPM.hpp). Tried to follow the new rules for variables declaration with documentation...
      NEW TRY to add the updated version of cohesiveFrictionalContactLaw called cohesiveFrictionalPM (see revision 2068)
      SORRY FOR THE REDUNDANCY... updated comments in cohesiveFrictionalPM.hpp to be consistent with the computation
      correction of few bugs in CohesiveFrictionalPM
      fix almost all of the classes related to CapillaryCohesiveLaw (except TriaxialtestWater) to suit YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_* macros. Everything compiles but the efficiency of the code needs to be tested.
      This version fixes a bug which produced FATAL ERROR when 2100 version was launched. SORRY.
      Removed CapillaryRecorder and ContactStressRecorder. Renamed SimpleElasticRelationshipsWater to Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_CapillaryLawPhys (can probably be removed as it is identical to Ip2_Frictmat_FrictMat_FrictPhys...) and CapillaryCohesiveLaw to CapillaryLaw. Modified all Capillary related files.
      some updates of capillary files. Rk: all must be tested!
      -updates for capillary files (doc in Law2_..._Capillarity and changes in CapillaryStressRecorder)\n\n -add a feature to CohesiveFrictionalPM (creation of CFpmState to stock number of broken bonds)
      fix compiling error in previous rev (but some warnings linked to TriaxialStressController.hpp)
      new line added at the end of CohesiveFrictionalPM to avoid corresponding warning + cleaning
      some updates in CohesiveFrictionalPM. Unfortunately, the law still does not work in macroscale simulations...
      CohesiveFrictionalPM update - add normalization of a quaternion + other few changes

Luc Sibille (2):
      I added the (updated) ThreeDTriaxialEngine, and it is also to see if we managed to make bzr working through an ssh tunnel
      - update of ThreeDTriaxialEngine with YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS_CTOR_PY \n - modified ThreeDTriaxialEngine to be able to perform internal compaction (growing particles) \n - modified TriaxialStateRecorder to be able to use it with ThreeDTriaxialEngine

Unknown (5):
      1. Make all paths given to scons on the command line COLON separated rather than space separated. BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE if you used scons in scripts (doesn't affect saved profiles). (Rationale: impossible to save the option in shell and later use it due to quoting issues)     2. Optionally set PATH as argument to scons (you can use scons PATH=$PATH as well)     3. Enhance VTKRecorder to record interactions andsome data on them.
      1. Fixes in scons for qt path (hopefully OK now); remove VTKINCDIR, use CPPPATH which alread exists     2. Improve yade-multi web interface (keep it running if --http-wait specified; show total time at the end)     3. Fixed in VTKRecorder and CPM
      1. Enhance yade-multi to query running jobs for status (percentage, step number etc), to keep connections, allow more fine-grained thread number control     2. Add some more cpm data (like sigma, sigmaMean, tau)     3. Enhance vtkrecorder to save those cpm data     4. Don't set matplotlib backend in yade.plot automatically, since ti breaks in headless environments     5. Add O.tags.has_key
      A typo in SConstruct.
      getClassIndexStatic() member turned to public.

Vincent Richefeu (2):
      - Increase DISTANCE_MAX     - use gcc-4.0 (4.3 doesn't work correctly on mac snow leopard)
      Rewrite KinematicLocalisationAnalyser::DefToFile for vtk format.

Václav Šmilauer (264):
      1. Hopefully fix vtk libs in SConstruct (?)     2. Add compress parameter to VTKRecorder (doesn't seem to make any difference in the output files, however...?)     3. Add CPM damage to VTKRecorder     4. Move spiralProject to Shop, to be usable from within c++     5. Add a 2 functions to compute 2d and 3d stresses to yade.eudoxos
      1. Enhance VTKRecorder to save more CPM data     2. Add confinement storage to CpmMat; CpmStateUpdater now computes that.     3. Add method to get aabb of Gauss-smoothed domain.
      1. Update examples/concrete/uniax.py and add CpmPhysDamageColorizer to renamed classes dictionary with warning.
      1. Use colon as separator to all path parameters to scons (PATH, CPPPATH etc), to avoid shell escaping insaneness. NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE if you call scons from scripts with multiple paths. Scons.profile-* files will work.     2. Add PATH parameter to scons, for things like pkg-config that we call during the configure stage (you can propagate whole path by saying scons PATH=$PATH)     3. Extend VTKRecorder to record interactions as well; add some cpm-related parameters.     4. avgStress is now Vector3r     5. Fix openGL-less builds (missing parenthesis in core/SConscript)
      1. Remove VTKINCDIR (duplicates already existing CPPPATH)     2. Fix handling of QTDIR (hopefully?)     3. Yade multi now displays total time at the end, takes --jobs (long option for -j), and the http server keeps running as long as the summary page is requested if run with --http-wait     4. Fix computation of sxx, syy, szz in cpm
      Yade-multi, VTKRecorder enhancements, &c
      1. Fix compilation on nfs (unable to delete .nfs* files)     2. remove debug message from the info socket     3. Make SpiralEngine assign velocities to (nondynamic) bodies so that when velocityBins are used, contacts are not missed.
      1. Add example of generating randomly-packed tunnel-like scene (6 lines of python code).     2. Add explicit check for physics dispatchers in InteractionDispatcher even in the optimized build.
      Fix what seems like bug in is2is4scg...
      1. Set timeout on infosocket     2. Add velocity bins to uniax.py example
      1. New yade.post2d module for 2d post-processing (raw/smooth scalar/vector field plots), with docs and examples     2. Add epydoc brief documentation to all python modules     3. Change constructor of GaussAverage in python to take always the relThreshold parameter
      1. New BodyVector written from scratch: supports body removal, intelligently allocates new ids at insertion. Is now default; a few pecent faster than BodyRedirectionVector which will be removed after a while.     2. Remove BodyAssocVector     3. Remove mass-spring for good     4. Add body removal support to InsertionSortCollider     5. Add empty body support to NewtonsDampedLaw, GravityEngine, OpenGLRenderingEngine and a few others     6. Wrap body removal from python     7. scripts/test/remove-body.py to demonstrate continuous dynamic body addition/removal.
      1. Remove InteractionHashMap
      Add 'deprecated' feature which guards code pending removal.     To compile those, you have to add 'deprecated' to features.
      1. Add infinite axis-aligned planes (Walls), interacting with spheres; I would like to deprecate Boxes soon. scripts/test/wall.py show the functionality, utils.wall create ready-made body.     2. Add Walls to triaxial test as an option to facets and boxes.     3. Unbreak ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw (passing neverErase broke virtual function resolution -> exception)     4. Make Simulation controller always open, closing it quits yade. Generator accessible from controller; player must be accessed from controller by opening generator, closing it (where by main window apprears), then opening player.     5. Change prototype for InteractingGeometry functors, to get some information about the openGL context (scene radius and center, ATM).
      1. Remove all deprecated classes as described in the last commit.     2. Start flagging code needing GeometricalModel by YADE_REQUIRE_FEATURE(shape). Once it compiles without shape, affected classes will be removed.
      Remove GeometricalModel from everywhere, unless you compile with the 'shape' features. Many classes had to be disabled; those who care about them are expected to fix them so that they don't rely on GeometricalModel. I will post on the mailing list on how to do that.
      Trivial fix. But shape feature is no longer supported, fix such things yourself next time, if you need them.
      1. For each interaction, save when it was last seen by the collider. Adapt SpatialQuickSortCollider for that (remove Interaction::cycle), it saves 2 loops over interactions. The deletion is triggered in InteractionDispatcher/InteractionGeometryDispatcher afterwards. This infrastructure is neede for the grid collider.
      1. Flatten file hierarchy a little bit.     2. Add MetaEngine{1,2}D and EngineUnit{1,2}D to the MetaEngine.hpp and EngineUnit.hpp instead of having them in separate headers.
      Remove 'deprecated' features from SCons files since they're not in the codebase anymore.
      1. Change syntax of python docstrings to restructured text instead of epytext (for future compatibility)     2. Workaround CPPPATH error saving option     3. Make SpatialQuickSortCollider skip boundless bodies     4. Fix rendering bodies with names (i.e. selectables)
      Initial commit of new Material and State classes that will replace PhysicalParameters in the future. No changes in functionality.
      1. Fix crash when removing bodies with velocityBins and MetaInteractingGeometry2AABB     2. Add option to draw normals for InteractingFacet (off by default); see scripts/test/remove-body.py (commented)
      Fix compile error introduced in last commit.
      Rollback point for adding YADE_REQUIRE_FEATURE(physpar) everywhere.
      rollback point 2
      Build core only OK (no gui,python,extra)
      NewtonsDampedLaw, Clumps, SpatialQuickSortCollider compile.
      Checkpoint before replacing PhysicalParametersMetaEngine and friends
      REMOVED PhysicalParameters, add Material and State classes.     DISABLED many (most) plugins, I ask the respective authors/users to fix them.
      1. A few small leftovers.
      1. Initialize dnesity to 4800 in CpmMat     2. Add warning if passing obsolete physParamsClass to utils.{sphere,facet,box,wall}     3. Add Material.cpp to ensure virtual functions work properly (not sure if they didn't, but now they do)     4. Fix uniax.py
      1. shared materials; see scripts/test/facet-sphere.py and also py/tests/omega.py.     2. added some regression tests for Omega     3. python iterator over O.bodies silently skips erased bodies now     4. finally rename all MetaBody::transientInteractions to MetaBody::interactions
      1. Fix uninitialized memebrs in Material (thans Anton)     2. Add equivalent of dispSe3 to OpenGLRenderingEngine directly     3. Fix pack.py
      1. Make the optimized build default (as per Sega's suggestion); it also sets linkStrategy to monolithic (is that OK?)     2. Add some vtk dirs to default CPPPATH     3. Fix periodic boundaries in OpenGL & remove some YADE_SHAPE stuff from there.     4. Fix some warnings     5. Fix pack.randomDensePack **kw     6. Adapt examples/concrete/uniax.py to shared materials
      1. Add Material::newAssocState creating State instance that is supposed to go along with given material; wrapped in python. It is used by utils.{sphere,facet,box,wall} functions now (hence by most or all body-construction things in python)     2. Fix py/post2d.py and examples/concrete/uniax-post.py     3. Fix crash for material-less bodies in scripts/test/regular-sphere-pack.py
      1. Move import functions from utils to yade.ymport (sorry, import is python keyword and cannot be used ;-) ). yade.utils contains proxy function that warn and call the implementation in ymport.     2. Added virtual book Material::stateTypeOk(State*).     2. MetaBody checks that material--state couples are OK at the first run (like initializers, but not listed among initializers...); throws on error. Added this to regression tests.     3. O.step() now calls MetaBody::moveToNextTimeStep() directly, instead of spawning worker for 1 iteration.     4. Adapt stl import test to yade.ymport (the facets look weird, though?)
      (forgotten: remove prototypes for incrementCurrentIteration and incrementSimulationTime that are no longer used from Omega.hpp)
      Regression check that NULL state throws (if there is a material) as well.
      1. Merge PeriodicInsertionSortCollider into InsertionSortCollider (periodicity detected automatically); PeriIsoCompressor moved to a separate file.     2. Initialize GranularMat properties (such as posisson't ratio) to arbitrary but non-zero values (avoids NaN's and disappearing bodies, bug #488100)     3. Re-enable clump logic in NewtonsDampedLaw (was #ifdef'd out), fixes bug #488100     4. Change prototypes of Shop::sphere and other methods, to take advantage of shared materials.     5. Change Collider::probeBoundingVolume prototype to return vector<body_id_t> instead of storing it in the collider itself.
      1. Enable velocityBins in pack.randomDensePack for periodic compression, speedup of about 13% (quite small?)
      1. Fix Bruno's compile error pkg/dem/meta/Shop.cpp:281: error: operands to ?: have different types     'boost::shared_ptr<Material>' and 'boost::shared_ptr<GranularMat>'     2. Fix warning's from out-of-order initializer in State.
      1. add #error to DataRecorder so that people don't use it, with explanation.     2. Add Recorder, deriving from PeriodicEngine and taking care of opening file.     3. Derive TriaxialStateRecorder from Recorder. (Anton: do the same for CohesiveStateRPMRecorder, I don't want to edit it since the version would probably diverge if you work on it now)     4. Fix PositionOrientationRecorder (is that one being used at all?)     5. Rewrite Singleton (to work accross different translation units)     6. Remove qt3 from 'exclude'. Enabling opengl requires qt3 automatically now.     7. Remove lib/sqlite3x, which was only used in noew-removed SQLiteRecorder     8. Experimental main in python (not fully functionaly for now)
      1. Re-enable temporarily commented code.
      1. Re-enable PeriodicPythonEngine and a few other YADE_REQUIRE_FEATURE(PYTHON) that I overlooked     2. Make the python main program work with plugins (RTLD_GLOBAL in both DynLibManager and python); doesn't work with openmp and opengl (investigation ongoing), looks promising otherwise. The program is called yade-trunk-dbg-py and such; not all options of the c++ main is implemented (yet?).     3. (In previous commit) Remove loading preferences.xml, just use QtGUI if possible and enabled, otherwise "only" python console.
      1. Remove rests of Preferences.     2. Remove HUP emergency saving (was disabled since long anyway)
      1. Add chunkSize option that determines how many plugins will be compiled together. (orthogonal to linkStrategy, that one determines how many will be linked to together). Should avoid issue with monolithic link on machines with less RAM; allows parallel compilation of plugins on machines with lots of RAM. Defaults to 20.     1. Re-enable crash warning in pyboot.cpp
      1. Remove implementation of global functions from Tetra.hpp to Tetra.cpp (gave errors on linking multiple objects including that same header.)     2. Add Body().geom as alias for (now deprecated?) Body().mold
      Make YADE_DEBUG work as expected (set debug leverl with log4cxx); avoid possible crash when logging during early log4cxx initialization.
      1. Change prototype for InteractionGeometryMetaEngine to receive const State& instead of const Se3r&. Add const Vector3r& shift2 for peroioditiy (ZERO by default).
      1. Fix Sega's and Anton's bug which was introduced in r1820 (keeping return from older version, instead of continue :-| )
      1. Rename EngineUnits to Functors, MetaEngines to Dispatchers (only the 4 types that we will keep). Python scripts should not be affected, except for raising deprecation warnings for the old names     2. Fix corner cases in deprecated names logic in python
      1. Rename MetaBody to World (it had to be done at some point, regardless of what the name is)     2. Add Engine::world, set before every call in moveToNextTimestep     3. Change names of a few related methods
      1. Fix "rootBody" in FileGenerator saver.
      1. Add scan&replace scons builder     2. Get libstdc++ path from the compiler, embed it in main.py; it runs fine     3. Fix temporary filename in Omega (forgotten dir separator)
      (doesn't compile, will fix in a few minutes; need to transfer between computers now) cleanup of python boot code
      1. Add yade.system module containing most startup things     2. yade-trunk-py usable now; startup is _much_ faster than the c++ main :-) (lazy linkage?). If everything works well, the c++ main will be deprecated soon (though still functional)
      1. Add YADE_LINK_EXTRA_LIB so that plugin can request to be linked with additional library (used in MicroMacroAnalyser)     2. Add -frounding-math when compiling with CGAL     3. Lot of reorganization of python code. Yade is now fully usable (it seems) with the python main (yade-trunk-py), and also lodable from pure python
      1. Fix assertion failure in NewtonsDampedLaw triggered by clumps in debug mode (typo)     2. Fix periodicity for Dem3Dof classes     3. Don't put things to __builtins__ in python, from yade import * will import wrappers as necessary into current global scope instead.     4. Expose Omega as yade.wrapper.O instance in the c++ code directly.
      1. Error out if adding the same body twice from python     2. First steps for user tutorial (please do not edit now)
      1. Move TesselationWrapper to lib/triangulation.     2. Main program (e.g. yade-trunk) is now in python; the old is yade-trunk-cxx. Most functionality should be the same, but please do report undesired behavior.     3. Adjust ipython configuration to be more friendly.     4. Improve default log4cxx output format     5. rename yade.PythonTCPServer to yade.remote     6. Remove annoying "INFO: sanitize failed" warnings     7. SimulationController now closes on escape or any function key.
      1. Rename World to Scene, as Bruno suggested. It feels better, we are no gods to create worlds...     2. Rename BoundingVolume to Bound; BoundingVolumeDispatcher to BoundDispatcher; dtto for Functor     3. The 'shape' feature was renamed to 'geometricalmodel' feature to not conflict with the following:     4. Rename InteractingGeometry to Shape     5. Rename ef2_*_Sphere_Dem3DofGeom to Ig2_*_Sphere_Dem3DofGeom     6. Rename ConstitutiveLaw to LawFunctor, ConstitutiveLawDispatcher to LawDispatcher
      1. Fix many warnings in various parts of python code related to renaming.
      1. Rename data members to follow types: Body::boundingVolume → Body::bound, Body::interactingGeometry → Body::shape. Old names are still present as references with deprecation warning by the compiler. Regression tests passing.
      1. make realVersion to be bzr revision     2. Re-enable Controller at startup always     3. Always rebuild python template files invisibly, since they wouldn't spot revision change otherwise (very fast)
      1. Fix the plot example.
      1. Add PeriTriaxController, with sample script in scripts/test/periodic-triax.py; works perfectly     2. Fix stress sign in PeriIsoCompressor (summing abs stresses still broken)     3. Handle periodic boundary moves with velocityBins     4. Rename ncb to scene in NewtonsDampedLaw (gradual change)
      1. Fix (hopefully) an issue with log4cxx 0.9 reported by build robot.
      (Python 2.5 fix for robot)
      1. Enhance PeriTriaxController for controlling strain/stress in periodic simulations; stress and strains appear to be physically correct now (however, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/493102)     2. Add examples/concrete/periodic.py, showing uniaxial/biaxial periodic loading. Results are awesome.     3. Fix stiffness computation for Cpm.     4. Add (unpolished) pack.randomPeriPack for generating periodic packings.     5. Add some sphinx doc files (no contents, just skeleton).
      1. Change prototype to InterationGeometryFunctor (see https://www.yade-dem.org/index.php/API_Changes)     1. Write some docs
      1. Fix PeriTriaxController example
      1. Refactor parameter table support (one reader class)     2. Fix yade-multi, add detection of regular exit with log4cxx crash at exit     3. Add --nice option to main.py     4. Make O.exitNoBacktrace output either "Yade: normal exit." (magic for OK exit, detected by yade-multi for instance) or "Yade: error exit".
      Fix reading parameters from table (thanks Anton for patience)
      Hopefully fix yade-multi https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/493686 now? Please confirm.
      1. Add Scene* Functor::scene, update it from all dispatchers at every step.     2. Add NewtonsDampedLaw::homotheticCellResize (0,1,2 for disabled, velocity or position update) (not tested at all)     3. Start removing Scene* ncb and Scene* rootBody etc from Engine::action as I stumble accross them. Please do the same, Engine::scene can be always used instead.
      1. Renames as discussed on yade-dev: NewtonsDampedLaw -> NewtonIntegrator, StandAloneEngine -> GlobalEngine, DeusExMachina -> PartialEngine. Regression tests ok.     2. Rename the confusing scons 'pretty' option to 'brief'. Profiles will be updated automatically, both options are valid for now.
      1. Finish renaming DeusExMachina -> PartialEngine
      1. Enable search engine in doxygen.
      1. Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/495358 (seems like concurrent access with Anton ;-) )     2. Add mask check to the collider     3. Initialize Body::id with Body::ID_NONE rather than -1     4. First attempt at doctest (for utils.sphere)
      1. Don't call CreateIndex in Materia::Material (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/495437)     2. Add dipl and rot methods to body, for querying displacement and rotation relative to reference position and orientation (moved from the python wrapper).     3. Add .classIndices to return list of class indices from the instance up to the top-level indexable from python.
      1. Rename Sphere (as GeometricalModel) to SphereModel (to facilitate InteractingSphere -> Sphere soon)     2. Initialized density to 1000 in Material, to avoid weird explosions     3. Add scripts/tests/triax-basic.py, a TriaxialTest in python
      1. A few renames: Facet → FacetModel, Box → BoxModel, GLDrawSphere → GLDrawSphereModel, GLDrawBox → GLDrawBoxModel     2. Remove shadowVolume functors, since they were not used anywhere in OpenGLRenderingEngine
      1. Rename GLDraw* to Gl1_*     2. Scene no longer inherits from Body, some of its properties are "emulated" (bound, shape). Not sure if Shape is really needed, perhaps for periodicity things etc in one place? It can be in the class itself just as well.     3. Remove MetaInteractingGeometry2AABB from all files (no longer needed); backwards-compatibility with python assured.
      Hotfix for twice-renamed Bo1_SceneShape_Aabb.
      1. Add some introspection interfaces to Indexables and dispatchers, as needed for Programmer's manual (https://yade-dem.org/sphinx/prog.html#multiple-dispatch), remove dead code, some cleanups.
      1. Move lib/triangulation stuff to CGT namespace as suggested by Bruno in https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg02658.html
      1. Rename SpheresContactGeometry to ScGeom     2. Rename corresponding functors:     InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry -> Ig2_Box_Sphere_ScGeom     InteractingFacet2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry -> Ig2_Facet_Sphere_ScGeom     InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry -> Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom
      1. Rename InteractingBox -> Box, InteractingSphere->Sphere, InteractingFacet->Facet.
      1. Fix renaming conflict (InteractingSphere->Sphere shadowed by older Sphere->SphereModel)
      1. use stderr for standard startup messages     2. add scripts/test/dispatch-torture.py for visualizing dispatch matrices in html. Add support HTML.py module from the web.     3. call cleanupTemps if exiting; we should leave cruft in /tmp/yade-* only if crashing before trying to exit (unusual)
      1. Make MetaInteractingGeometry2AABB warning more descriptive.
      1. Remove Scene::{cellMin,cellMax}, use just Scene::cellSize; update all related code and scripts     2. Change python interface: Omega.periodicCell=Vector3 (only size, no more min/max)     3. Add (not yet used) core/Cell.hpp header. Will be accessible as Scene::cell, once used.
      1. call centerScene() in GLViewer ctor, bind C to centerScene if no body is selected (was deactivated most likely by mistake, bzr annotate thinks it was me...!?). This should fix bug reported by Chiara for TriaxialTest with UpperCorner=Vector3(12,12,12)
      Fix missing import in py/post2d.py
      1. Use Scene::cell instead of Scene::cellSize; update all code     2. Have O.cellSize (instead of O.periodicCell; add wrapper with warning) and add O.cellShear     3. Add scripts/test/periodic-shear.py (purely for showing the display things, no interactions etc yet!)
      Do pending renames:         *  AABB → Aabb         * Interacting{Box,Sphere,Facet}2AABB → Bo1_{Box,Sphere,Facet}_Aabb         * Wall2AABB → Bo1_Wall_Aabb         * GLDrawAABB → Gl1_Aabb
      1. Finish implementation of sheared periodic space.     2. Fix bug which might have caused missed asymetric (Facet - Sphere, for instance) in periodic space, when interaction order was reversed.     3. Add possiblity to pass a callable to utils.spheres' material parameter, to avoid shared material properties when called indirectly (pac.randomDensePack)     4. Remove Aabb::{center,halfSize}, since they were used only rarely and were redundant.
      1. Remove abstract RenderingEngine     2. Remove SceneShape and related classes
      1. Add python2.5 relative module import workaround (hope it works)     2. Move some python accessors from yadeWrapper to their respective classes     3. Half work on periodic cell scaling in the OpenGL renderer
      1. Add ctor priorities, but only for gcc >= 4.3 (for early logging and plugins; necessary for the next point)     2. Register Functor core class in the factory (will be done for the rest soon, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/498337)     3. Wrap Matrix3 class in python, write unit tests for it.     4. Re-enable ForceEngine and FacetTopologyAnalyzer     5. Update a few scripts in test/scripts
      1. Implement arbitrary strain for periodic cell (see scripts/test/periodic-shear.py). Most code adapted accordingly.     2. ClassFactory now logs to cerr if YADE_DEBUG env var is defined, not otherwise. This avoids initialization order of plugins vs. ClassFactory itself
      1. Fix weird behavior reported by Luc at https://lists.launchpad.net/yade-dev/msg02794.html (numerical issue)     2. Fix crash at body selection (wrong dispatcher arguments)     3. Add warnings about what Luc observed, should it happen again.
      1. Allow spaces after YADE_REQUIRE_FEATURE (before parenthesis) and around its argument inside parentheses.
      1. Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/499697 (sorry, Luc)
      1. Rename BexContainer to ForceContainer, O.bex to O.forces etc. Mostly backwards-compatible in python.     2. Add Shop::flipCell which changes shear without affecting interactions (by integral steps), demonstrated in scripts/test/periodic-shear.py (not yet fully tested, but doesn't crash ;-) ) [BROKEN due to recent VELGRAD changed]     3. Add InteractionsContainer::eraseNonReal
      (Fix unsignificant hasShear mistake in Cell, clean old code there)
      1. Make python interaction iterator return only real interactions. (TODO: regression test & check scripts for compat)
      1. Add cell strain rate integration to the Scene loop.     2. Remove Cell::Hsize and friends, remove VELGRAD; unify both approaches.     3. Update some scripts, fix Shop::flipCell (demo in scripts/test/periodic-triax-velgrad.py)
      1. Use Cell::trsf instead of Cell::strain (which really meant trsf-Id)     2. NewtonIntegrator now precomputes cellTrsfInc for the current step, instead of using Cell::getTrsfInc getting increment from the previous step (!?)     3. Update scripts and other code.
      1. fix size computation in cell     2. Save history at exit, incremental history search with arrows up/down     3. Don't return false in Ig2_Box_Sphere_ScGeom for existing intr
      1. Separate rotation&shear from scaling in cell. Fix possible error (but also possibly not?) error in collider. Spheres' Aabb's are still probably not correctly enlarged.
      1. Forgotten new file.
      1. Re-enable error check in InsertionSortCollider, make the explanation clearer     2. Fix sphere's Aabb (hopefully) (Bruno, could you check that?)     3. Worker thread now catches exception from simulation and O.wait() (or O.run()) will rethrow it; avoids crashes from exceptions.
      1. Preliminary attempt at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/c++-numpy-arrays (for postprocessing and similar), example in eudoxos.testNumpy     2. SpherePack::makeCloud can be asked for negative number of spheres (= as much as possible)
      1. May fixes for errors found when running larger simulation.     2. Move material properties from Ip2_CpmMat_CpmMat_CpmPhys to CpmMat itself.     3. Some reverts in PeriIsoCompressor (log strain and usage of refSize)
      1. Add clone function to python objects, taking optinal python dictionary with changed attributes     2. Fix PeriIsoCompressor for examples/concrete/periodic.py     3. GaussAverage relThreshold argument is now optional in python, as it is in c++ (again)
      1. Fix examples/concrete/periodic.py     2. Fix (partially) scaling of periodic cell resize in OpenGL
      Implement https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/sphere-gl-stripes (weird lighting things). Must be enabled via "Gl1_Sphere(stripes=True)" in python.
      1. Fix SpherePack().makeCloud() in python
      1. Remove some old docs     2. Attempt at update-alternatives     3. packaging updates
      1. FIx core class registration in the factory (fixes inheritance info in python for such classes)     2. Fix debian packaging, use update-alternatives
      Bulk of consistency renames (hopefully last for long time to come):     * ElasticMat → ElastMat     * GranularMat → FrictMat     * NormalInteraction → NormPhys     * NormalShearInteraction → NormShearPhys     * ElasticContactInteraction → FrictPhys     * SimpleElasticRelationships → Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_FrictPhys     * ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw → Law2_ScGeom_FrictPhys_Basic     * Law2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_Elastic → Law2_Dem3Dof_FrictPhys_Basic
      1. Document PeriodicEngine (doxygen comment in the header)     2. Fix runtimePREFIX vs. PREFIX in yade-multi (only affects packages, not regular builds)
      1. Fix epydoc generation with python main (thansk Anton for th yade-cxx hint!)     2. Expose O.tmpFilename returning unique filename in temporary dir that is deleted at exit     3. Do not import yade.plot at startup, since it initialized matplotlib to TkAgg, which needs $DISPLAY (and fails later if no $DISPLAY exists, i.e. for headless simulations)     4. Fix shear stress computation in CpmStateUpdater
      1. Fix numpy_boost and TesselationWrapper     2. Start moving python registration code inside classes themselves. That should allow proper class hierarchy in python as well as (faster) object.attribute access instead of hacky object['attribute']. Please report errors you might encounter.     3. Resurrect Dem6DofGeom, doesn't work for now.
      1. Add new-style python wrapper to most classes that were previously wrapped in yadeWrapper.cpp. Let me know if this breaks something for you.
      1. Add YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS and YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS_PY macros for python wrapping, including documentation (e.g. https://yade-dem.org/sphinx/yade.wrapper.html#yade.wrapper.Body). All classes should be converted in the future.     2. Remove global functions (diagDiv, componentMinVector, ...) from the wm3 wrapper
      1. Add new python wrapper to a few more classes.     2. Make python's executable have real python path in the #! line at the beginning (that is, the same python interpreter used for running scons)
      1. Fix body_id_t typedef (add includes)     2. Check body id when accessing ForceContainer from python     3. Override prefix in config.py already if YADE_PREFIX is set
      1. Fix python docstring options for boost <=1.35 (hopefully)
      1. Classes now warn at startup if they don't register &document attributes with YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS & friends.     2. Add YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRDECL_CTOR_PY macro that declares, documents and initializes data members.     3. Add NaN to lib/base/yadeWm3Extra.hpp, which is std::numeric_limits<Real>::signalingNaN()     4. Fix syntax in a few python modules, away from the old obj['attr'] to obj.attr
      1. Add detection & mention workaround for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/boost1.38/+bug/457688     1. Convert a few more classes to YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS
      1. Re-disable CInem{CNC,KNC}Engines (sorry, Jerome)     2. don't compile cxx main anymore; delete the executable from installation if present     3. Add help for --threads equali with OMP_NUM_THREADS
      1. Moved all (most) unused files to attic/* (such as those that have YADE_REQUIRE_FEATURE(PHYSPAR);). We will not keep them there indefinitely (they are in the history), though. If you want to re-enable some classes, fix them and move them back (using bzr mv) to pkg/*. If I inconsciously moved some file that was being used, please fix it yourself (it is unlikely, though).
      Get rid of physpas a geometricalshape relicts in non-attic code.
      1. Fix class registration macro without attributes (remove "cap" in Rpm LawFunctor as well)     2. Remove StretchPeriodicEngine, it was probably too complicated to be really used; remove yade.plot data reduction which was relying on StretchPeriodicEngine     3. Properly expose PeriodicEngine, PythonPeriodicRunner, VTKRecorder, FileGenerator to python
      1. Fix python registration of CohesiveStateRPMRecorder (YADE_PLUGIN was missing for PeriodicEngine and Recorder, it seems). Thanks Anton.
      1. Wrap many classes using YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRDECL_CTOR_PY and friends.     2. "Fix" problems with features=all (is rejected now, features must be written by hand)     3. Add |ystatic| sphinx role (for static data memebers)     4. Rename GLDrawCpmPhys to Gl1_CpmPhys
      1. Wrap yet more classes with YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS and friends. I strongly ask people to do the same for "their" classes (like Bruno for TriaxialTest and so on); I will not and it might make those classes unfunctional in the future.     2. Add documentation here and there, where it was lacking
      1. Remove wm3 includes from everywhere, use lib/base/Math.hpp instead (in preparation to the eigen switch). Regression tests passed.
      1. Remove a few forgotten files.
      1. Fix empty display (improperly initialized drawMask)
      1. Catch io exceptions in the gui     2. Detect io error and throw in IOFormatManager     3. Set config dir at startup, enabling use of logging.conf etc     4. Fix display issues we had. When not running script/xml from command line, yade doesn't display the controller (press F12 to have it). Let me know if this is OK or not.     5. Fix OpenGL initialization code.
      1. Add bin with 0 interactions to _utils.bodyNumInteractionsHistogram, hereby fixing utils.avgNumInteractions as well (thanks, Luc)
      1. Update comments in scripts/simple-scene-plot.py (thanks, Chiara)
      Document registration macros (will move to Programmer's manual later)
      (Add 2 more hyperlinks to ElasticContactLaw, once it serves as example for docs)
      1. Remove some garbage     2. Make code partially compile with the wm3-eigen glue.
      (more fixes for wm3-eigen compat)
      1. Fix compilation for per-class builds     2. Add manual wrapper for wm3 classes instead of the auto-generated one, to ease transition to eigen. Let me know if it broke something.
      Fix compilation error introduced in last commit; sorry.
      Fix setting # of OpenMP threads via -j switch
      1. do not build miniWm3 at all if not needed
      1. Document a few classes.
      Register TimeStepper with YADE_PLUGIN as it should be (that's the reason it wasn't reported as not being registered with YADE_BASE_DOC_* -- thanks Bruno for pointing that out)
      1. Add #ifndef YADE_* feature handling to implicit build scanner (till now, it was only supporting #ifdef YADE_*)
      rename sphere{From,To}File to {ymport,export}.text for consistency.
      1. Add scene->forces.sync() to several places
      Fix typo (Scene::force vs. Scene::forces). Sorry. Thanks to Chiara for reporting.
      1. Add no-alignment macros to compiler command line directly, this fixes compilation with eigen, including the tt.py test and scripts/regression-testss.py
      1. Fix plugin registration for CinemCNCEngine, remove some cruft, fix formatting, add hyperlinks.
      1. Fix quaternion/vector initializers in NormalInelasticityPhys     2. Fix some eigen related macros
      1. Add eudoxos.InteractionLocator and eudoxos.IntrSmooth3 for 3d smoothing of arbitrary quantities defined on interactions.     2. Adjust some docstring formatting
      1. Doc fixes     2. Change prototype for Funtor::getFunctor, since it doesn't seem to work from python now (perhaps it's that Functors don't inherit from Functor in python universe, actually?!)     3. Fix some stuff with class indices for GenericSpheresContact. (It doesn't seem to help, though, either)
      1. Fix instruction set (march) for debian packages     2. chunkSize=∞ if <= 0
      1. Add docs at several places     2. Update debian/rules to run tests     3. Add funnel.py scripts/test/CundallStrackTest.py     4. Add more formats to SnapshotEngine (don't seem to work, though)
      1. Add IntrCallback and BodyCallback (not yet really documented), for hooking into interaction loop in InteractionDispatchers and body loop in NewtonIntegrator (suggested by Bruno). Two real callbacks are defined, to compute summary (hence also mean) forces on interactions and bodies. Sample script is scripts/test/callbacks.py, but currently it crashes for reasons beyond my comprehension.     2. Remove Scene* ncb and similar stuff from everywhere, since all Engines have scene declared in the base Engine class and don't need it pass as arguments. Later, the prototype will be changed (Engine::action(void) etc).     3. Add docs here and there.
      1. Eninge::action and Engine::isActivated no longer takes Scene* pointer. It must be set beforehand by the caller (done e.g. in moveToNextTimeStep). Please check for suspicious crashes.     2. Remove PartialEngine::applyCondition, replace by action just like other engines (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/remove-partial-engine-apply-condition)     3. Resurrect JumpChangeSe3 engine     4. add py/_extraDocs.py for documentation of c++ classes/function written conveniently in python strings rather than c++ string literals.     5. Fix bug in Dem3DofGeom_SphereSphere, introduced when avoiding normalization of (0,0,0) vector; is OK now.
      1. devirtualize BodyContainer and InteractionContainer (they use implementation from BodyVector and InteractionVecMap). There is some speedup. I ask people (you) to run some simulation with the older and current version and report what they observe on the ML. I had more than 2x faster in some cases (in debug mode, though).     2. Fix chunkSize=-1 linkage (is like setting it to infinity)
      1. Set docstring format for yade.qt
      1. Code cleanups, docs     2. Make sure we are able to compile with boost::serialization (loading/saving works now as well, but no compression yet; about 3x faster for saving and even more for loading)     3. Enable boost-serialization feature for debian builds
      1. Don't create python proxy classes for those not using YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_*     2. Remove few deprecated things like O.bex and such.     3. Warn about object['attribute'] syntax     4. Add yade --update option, which will do in-place replace for deprecated class names. Run on scripts/test/*.py     5. Wrap ResetRandomPosition and PositionOrientationRecorder     6. Remove some olden scripts
      1. Move SpherePadder from extra to py/pack/SpherePadder     2. Add py/pack directory, to avoid too many files in py     3. Other small fixes
      1. Fix crasher in Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_FrictPhys (??)     2. Cleanup python code     3. Add feature gl2ps, hitting 'v' in the GL view will save PDF (seems to freeze on large scenes, but works nice on small ones)     4. Add special syntax for deprecated attributes. For testing, renamed Shape::diffuseColor to Shape::color.
      1. Fix gl2ps, works even for larger scenes now.
      1. Rename many attributes in OpenGLRenderingEngine, using the deprecated attribute framework     2. Add pickling support to Serializables (useless)     3. Fixes of docstrings here and there
      1. Disable deprecated attributes handling for gcc<=4.2, which gives errors on that code.
      1. Use BSP sort in gl2ps only if len(O.bodies)<100     2. Remove ClumpMemberMover, no longer used anywhere     3. Fix pack.regularHexa bug, reported by Nasibeh http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-users@lists.launchpad.net/msg01424.html
      1. Uniformize accumulator interface for open and openmp-less builds.
      1. Fix compilation of deprecated attributes for gcc 4.3 (thanks Jerome for reporting)     2. Re-add facet rendering code.     3. Add docs to predicates.
      1. TriaixalStressController: originally compilation fix, but Luc was faster; Bruno, I tried to replace on c-array with boost::array; if that works, you could use it for other c-arrays as well     2. Add yield surface query function from python to Law2_..._Cpm     3. Make plot support label translation via yade.plot.labels     4. make chunkSize very small for debian; add strip for the optimized build
      1. Fix action(Scene*) vs. action() virtuals (mass replace in attic as well), in TranslationEngine. Thanks to Nasibeh Moradi for reporting.
      1. Add doc/references.bib, which can be references from docstring using [Author2008]_ syntax (note the underscore).     2. Added a few bibliography items to test, and changed relevant docstrings -- see e.g.     https://www.yade-dem.org/sphinx/yade.wrapper.html#yade.wrapper.NewtonIntegrator.damping
      Add doc to SimpleViscoelasticPhys, add Jean-Francois' paper to both bibtex and SpherePadder's docs
      1. add axis parameter to utils.uniaxialTestFeatures, to force strain direction
      1. Import yade.plot when showing graph     2. Fix bibtex entry     3. Handle unseen interaction in InteractionDispatchers differently than with requestErase, as that will not work with certain colliders     4. Add from yade import utils to utils.py docstrings, and show full utils.sphere instead of sphere in session transcripts (thanks to Jerome for pointing that out)
      1. Add toy grid-based collider (very slow)
      1. Rename viscoelastic classes as discussed on the mailing list     2. FIx some docstrings.
      Fix weird crash http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-users@lists.launchpad.net/msg01482.html in glGetError() (disable error check)
      1. Reorganize engines a little bit, as discussed in http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg03337.html and other messages in the thread (trivial to change, though)     2. Small fixes at different places
      1. Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/539562 (thanks, Luc)     2. Fix import warning in yade.remote
      Fix monolithic build (#pragma once for BoundaryController and FieldApplier), sorry
      1. Add importing native SpherePadder meshes     2. Fix LSMGenGeo interaction with our own type Sphere (in yade itself and in SpherePadder (HACK!!)     3. Fix sample scripts for GenGeo and SpherePadder     4. Allow both gengeo and GenGeo imports     5. Fix ymport.gengeo (shift vs. moveto)
      1. Start filling NEWS for upcoming 0.5: do the same if you have some big things in mind     2. Fix hyperlinks in Gl1_Sphere doc
      1. Make python return Vector2r, Vector2r, Vector3i, Vector3r, Quaternionr and Matrix3r by reference rather than by value; fixes http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg03406.html and was introduced by fixing https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/539562. See explanation in Serializable.hpp.
      1. Replace the ugliest code I've ever written by something more sensible. Still ashamed, though, please forgive me.
      1. Completely remove HydraulicForceEngine which didn't exist in sources (removed by Bruno in previous commit)     2. Experimental binary io using boost::serialization     3. Some function in yade.eudoxos
      1. Some preliminary work to make boost:;serialization work (MUCH faster)
      1. Fix calling {pre,post}ProcessAttribute multiple times with boost::serialization.
      Fix unchanged name (Bruno, do you use scripts/rename-class.py, right? https://www.yade-dem.org/sphinx/prog.html#renaming-class)
      1. Skip yade::ObjectIO for boost::serialization-less builds. (thanks Nasibeh for reporting)
      Fix Jerome's problem with boost 1.35 (don't compile code uselessly)
      1. Fix cached values for cell and facet when modified from python     2. Fix table parsing for lines with 1 character onlyDynamic
      1. Clarify error message i Law2 functor is not found (thanks, Chiara)     2. Make static attributes initialized by values provided in YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_STATICATTRS     3. documentation fixes here and there
      1. Fix yade.plot broken in last commit     2. adjust interpolating-force example script
      1. Adjust interpolating-force.py script; present for Chia
      1. Fix boost::serialization and postProcessAttributes     2. Add scripts/test/serialization-benchmark.py for comparing serialization time/size (http://www.mail-archive.com/yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net/msg03496.html)     3. Fix bug #557124 (hopefully)     4. Don't call postProcessAttributes on Facet in utils.facet, as that is called automatically when setting vertices now.
      Some eigen compatibility stuff
      Some more replaces
      After some text replaces (IDENTITY etc); removed MarchingCube
      1. Replace things for eigen compatibility. See https://www.yade-dem.org/wiki/Wm3%E2%86%92Eigen for details. Code should not be changed functionally. Report if it is.     2. Remove PositionOrientationRecorder from everywhere.     3. Make the timestep entry behave differently: only when enter is pressed, it will change timestep. Fixes bug #394687
      1. Forgotten fixes.
      REALLY fix bad end iterator on InteractionContainer (since r2092!!). UPDATE your code, this makes simulations little wrong (some interaction might be processed twice in one step).

      1. Some garbage removal     2. Fix assertion in NewtonIntegrator
      1. Fixes for Eigen compatibility (compile with features eigen,nowm3)
      1. Add forgotten file
      1. Add docs for kineticEnergy     2. Complete wrapper for Eigen in Python (will be renamed from miniWm3Wrap to yade.math or similar later), passes scripts/regression-test.py now
      1. Rename miniWm3Wrap module to miniEigen. Let me know in case of regressions (shouldn't be, unless you imported that module directly)     2. Add documentation to the eigen wrapper, document operators (https://www.yade-dem.org/sphinx/external.html#module-miniEigen)     3. Add custom converters from sequences for all supported vector types
      1. Fix bug with facet import Luc reported (thanks)     2. Add None to separate y1 and y2 axis (instead of |||, which will still work, but is not documented anymore)     3. Add the possibility to plot multiple x axes with the save variable by adding spaces to the name in yade.plots     4. Rename TestWm3Wrapper to TestEigenWrapper
      1. Add backward-compat to Cpm model if from external files     2. Complete the eigen wrapper     3. Fix some docstrings.

Remove several Omega wrapper functions that really pertain to Scene, adapt code accordingly.     4. Remove bunch of useless files from attic (mostly seem to have equivalents in our tree, or are obsolete WRT code structure)

      0.20.2

Bruno Chareyre (22):
      A wrong comment on contact laws in PFC3D is removed.
      svn update - no real change (in principle)  - recovering from erased local file
      - Fix conflicts and prepare next implementation of isotropic compression
      - Few files missing in the previous commit.     - Add a new class for computing/recording micromechanical data based on     tesselation
      Still recovering from conflicted files... I hope this is the last one.
      A class with algorithm for analysing contacts-forces-displacements     statistics. Using the triangulation lib.
      1. Fixed a critical bug in ElasticContactInteraction (kn, was not registered and left undefined after loading a simulation).     2. Test if fn!=0 (i.e. contact exists) before adding kn/ks to the global stiffness.
      1. "Water" classes are updated based on the code developped locally (but not commited for a while) by Luc Scholtes.     2. Triangulation code updated as well (not compiled by default).
      1. Add a missing class (for the capillarity model), this fixes a compilation error in the previous commit due to the missing files.
      The "stopSimulation" command in the compression engine is now optional, as sometimes you don't want it to stop at all(1).     The default behaviour of the compressionEngine is not affected, with autoStopSimulation=true by default.     However, the TriaxialTest IS affected : it sets autoStopSimulation=false by default.
      1. Update capillary files and add a new engine for them.     2. Prepare for removing old useless classes (typically some variants of engines with "water" at the end)
      Remove useless dependency.
      -Avoid crash when computing fusion number (it was using pointers to deleted interractions)     FIXME : no distant meniscii for now due to deletion by the contact law.
      Base class for the solid-fluid coupling (E. Catalano PhD).
      -Register "thickness" so that sample dimensions are computed correctly (and not with 0 thickness)
      Dimensions could be 0 when "updateParameters" was called from TriaxialCompressionEngine before     TTController::action
      Missing  declarations in r1836.
      - cleanup : removing unused (and useless) "water" variants of engines     - some cleanup in recorders too
      Update of the read/write functions for the connection     with comsol. (coupling via Berkeley<->Grenoble mail servers! ;))
      Missing declarations of member variables.
      <none>
      Set default read/write behaviour as in Andrea's version.

Feng Chen (1):
      This is viscous force damping, equation similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping, damping parameters are controlled by betaNormal and betaShear, it is sometimes more realistic than the non-viscous (or say, local) damping.     While using this code, please make a reference to:

Janek Kozicki (54):
      ouch, forgot to mark INSTALL file as outdated. We need to update it.
      some cleanup in the files
      fix crashes of this->parentWidget()->parentWidget() in UI
      yade.cpp: more detailed info about compilation flags.     LatticeExample: added material parameters bond zone between steel fibres and cement matrix
      update to use latest scons 1.0.0
      don't refresh display when there's nothing to refresh
      support for generating multiple file with single NullGUI call
      add to SimulationController buttons for looking in different directions. The default view direction is now down along the direction of gravity.
      improved generation of steel fibres in lattice
      fixed snaphotNames in NullGUI for .xml.gz
      more configurable MakeItFlat,     TriaxialTest can be now a biaxial test as well.     small fixes in UIs
      make it compile with boost 1.35 (I wonder what 1.36 will bring)
      Fixed OpenGL problems with displaying spheres, which      - never occurred on my desktop      - I've seen them sometimes on other peoples computers, but never could reproduce them      - but finally have appeared on my laptop.
      up direction on Y     release 0.12.1
      created nearly empty snow package: pkg-snow
      Snow stuff - generate grains made of layers according to voxel data read from file. And daraw it.
      forgot some files
      - make it compile with boost 1.34     - some snow improvements
      - another fix. now it really compiles with boost 1.34
      1. TriaxialStressController reads radius from interactingGeometry
      Code wasn't compiling because of #include MicroMacroAnalyser - comment it out.
      1. argh, guys. svn HEAD must compile. You didn't check your commits and then I waste 1h to fix that. See this commit, to check what I had to comment out about WATER
      - added keyboard shortcut '.' that toggles grid subdivision by 10     - fixed error with grid step     - grid step is now shown in gl window
      small snow update
      another small snow update
      1. small snow update     2. fix compilation error by Vaclav (hey, you didn't compile again before commit! ;p )
      rename file to avoid case conflict with directory
      1. GLViewer - when sth. is selected don't move it to 0,0,0 position, but use its original position. This is done by delaying assignment to the next call of draw()
      - added extensive comments to the polyhedron code which will be used for collisions
      small snow update
      maybe spheres won't disappear anymore?
      a placeholder for drawing snow interactions
      changed guards to #pragma once
      postpone creating a 3d view, until a file is loaded. That should hopefully fix the problem with the primary view being empty.
      added AUTHORS file, for the purpose of updating file headers.     This was copied from  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Authors
      Why do I have the impression that I'm adding this file a second time? After all it's referred to in almost all source files "See file LICENSE for details.", right?
      sort people in alphabetical order
      sorry for bumping up revisions....
      Snow, as it is finished by me. Further work on it will to be done by next post-doc     researcher who wants money from EU for working on this :)
      fix miniwm3 / full wm3 compilation error
      I forgot to add those, sorry. (I wonder how it could stay unnoticed for so long ;)
      add option for horizontal or vertical wires in fibre reinforced concrete.
      1. correct display of lattice rods on 0th iteration     2. on/off switch for using different stiffness for tension and compression in lattice     3. fixed a bug in BodyRedirectionVector related to deleting of bodies     4. two more lattice examples     5. few more safety checks in lattice code
      1. NullGUI was still usin .gz while thay are not supported anymore     2. small lattice update
      sanitize stupid numers in QtGUI, eg. 0.1299999999999 becomes 0.13
      small fix
      after isNew and isReal are removed I'll update the code to use new contact logic.
      Add an option to display DOFs and body IDs in the OpenGL window
      - Lattice uses DOFs now     - old implementation is still accessible by setting a flag backward_compatible, so that hundreds of my old FileGenerator files will still work     - some improvements to recording strains and forces
      - fix all my warnings     - lattice generator improvements wrt concrete with steel fibres
      - some improvements wrt to generation of densely packed aggregates and steel fibres in the concrete structure
      - testing command "bzr commit --fixes lp:414868"     - fixing bug 414868
      Fix stupid error introduced when we have migrated to bex container
      1. get snow code to run, albeit still buggy     2. why dynamic_casts stopped working everywhere, that's a mystery to me     3. interactions isNew doesn't exist anymore, snow code needs update for this

Jerome Duriez (9):
      Added :     - Engines for simulating shear tests at constant normal displacement, normal stress or normal rigidity (CinemDNCEngine, CinemCNCEngine and CinemKNCEngine) for samples     deriving from SimpleShear PreProcessor (added also, former DirectShearCis)     - ContactLaw1 : a contact law with Moment Transfer and inelastic behaviour in compression : see comments. With correspondant Relationships and type of Interactions.     NB : sorry for the name : i didn't search too long for a more explicit one but I think personly that the comments in the files (and I tried to put some) are far much better     than the one
      - Add of the paragraph for the CL1Relationships, which was forgotten, in the corresponding SConscript
      A (last ?) error concerning last revision in the paragraph CL1Relationships : "CL1Interaction" does not exist, that's ContactLaw1Interaction
      -ContactLaw1 : correction of prototype of action() : it needed a body, whereas now action methods of Engines need a Metabody. This led the simulation to crash and is     now fixed     - SimpleShear : now all is normaly done so that this preprocessor could be used (with success) with this ContactLaw. Moreover it is now linked to the     GlobalStifnessTimeStepper (instead of the ElasticOne)
      Suppress of some useful comments (sorry for the extra mail)
      (At last) The good Sconscript file
      - The GlobalStifnessCounter engine (for correct use of GlobalStifnessTimeStepper) was forgotten in the preprocessor SimpleShear...
      - Correction of the headers of two files "ContactLaw1Interaction" which were commited by me and not by Bruno     - Some features of ContactLaw1Interaction were declared in ElasticContactInteraction. This was a mistake totally not planned (and the fact it was in svn also was not     noticed) and is now corrected
      - End of the job by suppressing also the corresponding lines in .cpp...

Luc Sibille (1):
      I added a new engine "ThreeDTriaxialEngine" to perform triaxial simulations with an independant control in stress or in strain in     the three space directions respectively. In this goal, the TriaxialStressControlEngine has been sligtly modified to impose a     different stress value or strainrate in each space direction. I hope I have broken nothing!

Sergei Dorofeenko (32):
      1. A new algorithm for facets. It use only a class Facet, so classes Vertex and Edge are deprecated and has been removed.     2. Add functions to python gui for import geometry from stl and for creating facets.     3. Add Shop::inscribedCircleCenter for calculate position of center of triangle inscribed circle (use it for set facet's se3.position).     4. ForceRecorder now take cary about old data files and renaming them.     5. SimulationPlayer now allow wire body form view tab.

      1.First worked version of SpheresFactory engine. Example in examples/SpheresFactory     2.Added PersistentSAPCollider::probeBoundingVolume function (for using with SpheresFactory)     3.InteractionGeometryMetaEngine::explicitAction has been modified to remove artifical (as me seems) asserts.     4.python import_stl_geometry now return list of body ids instead only their number.     5.import stl geometry now allows import facets without BoundingVolume  and InteractingGeometry.     6.Fixed dynamic_cast for BroadInteractor.
      1. SpheresFactory allows now to create spheres in a convex volume.     2. SimulationController estimates total simulation time if stopAtIteration>0.
      1. SimulationPlayer now allows to reload filters without reloading all simulation.     2. ColorizedVelocityFilter now allows to setup minValue,maxValue without reloading the filter.
      Fixed bug in RotationEngine: rotationAxis now normalized in action(), not in postProcessAttributes()
      ColorizedVelocityFilter counts a scale for each frame, without using previous min,max values.
      Class SimpleViscoelasticInteraction is renamed to ViscoelasticInteraction and is inherited from ElasticContactInteraction now.
      1. Convert SimpleViscoelasticContactLaw to ConstitutiveLaw engine unit (Spheres_Viscoelastic_SimpleViscoelasticContactLaw).     2. SimulatonPlayer have now Display tab as one in SimulationController.
      1. The experimental widget for drawing a color scale for colorized velocity filter.     2. Convenient python function utils.ColorizedVelocityFilter.

      Realise InsertionSortCollider::probeBoundingVolume() so SpheresFactory now works
      SpheresFactory now can create a spheres by python function. See scripts/test/SpheresFactory/model.py for example.
      Add export python module with VTKWriter class (very initial) to export data from YADE to VTK-based post-processing tools
      Added a c++ VTKRecorder (for spheres and facets) and new feature 'vtk' needed for it.
      Add colors rec to VTKRecorder
      Add default path for VTK
      Fix VTKRecorder headers
      Fix VTKRecorder headers
      Add VTKINCDIR to configure options for directories where to look for VTK headers

Unknown (3):
      I added a new state at the triaxial compression test in order to realize isotropic compression by the walls displacement until a indicated porosity value. These modifications can be seen with generator file "TriaxialCompression" in the last three parameters (added).
      I corrected my errors on the triaxialtest files.Moreover, i added comments in the TriaxialCompressionEngine.hpp.
      The isotropic compaction into the TraxialTest is activated: 1)I have deleted the translationspeed parameter (now the translation speed of walls is the strainRate parameter) 2)I have activated the porosity parameter in the TriaxailStressController.cpp file

Vincent Richefeu (42):
      - initialize radius in InteractingSphere constructor.     - add new plugins used for membrane modelling.
      - add GLDraw plugin for BssSweptSphereLineSegment displaying
      - 'Membrane' (in fact geogrid) has been improved but still doesn't work...     - the class GroupRelationData has been add (not used yet) to define interacting parameters such as coefficient of friction or restitution that have nothing to do in the bodies parameters (in my opinion)
      - forgotten files
      - add the soft mgpost for DEM simulation post-processing and visualization.
      - set menus in english mode
      A very quick guide for mgpost (usage and XML format)
      a forgotten file in mgpost/doc
      - add a new tool for sphere packing (still in dev)     - some enhancement in mgpost interface
      - SpherePadder devel...
      SpherePadder devel...
      SpherePadder (devel: 5 steps ok)
      - SpherePadder update     - add a basic 'user friend' interface for sphere packing generation. The module can of course be used without this interface.
      Speed enhacement for the SpherePadder algorithm.
      Add possibility to make PNG screenshots (using libpng)
      Add a DataRecoder that generate MGP files (only for Spheres for the moment).     The MGP files can then be read with mgpost.
      - add a class based on CGAL for 3D triangulation.     - Packing method enhanced (place 380000 spheres in less than 2 min)
      Fix some bugs and enhance the display of positive and negative forces
      Fix some bugs
      Begin devel. of densification process
      2 files that were forgotten
      Simplify sphere shapes when if there number is increased
      Bug corrections (min and max radii)
      - overlap with spheres inserted by user -> bug fixed     - Densification begins to work
      Increase the number of colors for the display of body's groupMasks from 6 to 10
      We can now make the packing denser with a stop criterion based on the solid fraction or total number of spheres.
      Add BasicViscoelasticRelationships: an alternative to SimpleViscoelasticRelationships. It accounts for the effective mass of each contact and considere the parameter cn as a dimensionless ponderation of its critical value (computed for each contact). Parameter cs is set to zero for the moment.
      Add a boost.python wrapper (module packing)
      Add a function to SpherePadder_wrapper to pass the result back to python.     As Vaclav suggested, it is a list of (x,y,z,R) tuples.     (Complet integration into yade is not done yet)
      - Add 'HistoryRecorder' to save the sample and network state with a given time-step interval.     - Correct a small bug due to the fact that a Clump cannot be casted into a GeometricalModel (and I don't know why!)
      Use the clump mass instead of clump-member mass for the determination of the effective mass.
      Ooops! There was a bug

      Remove default linkage with libtiff (png is now prefered)
      Add an example of python script for SpherePadder
      Add GroupRelationData serialization (not used yet in *Relationships classes)     This class serves to manage parameters between bodies depending on their groupMasks.     Here is an example of 'command stream' in xml file to set the parameters:     <grpRelationData _className_="GroupRelationData"  commands_="[ngrp 2 parameter kn setall kn 1e6]" />
      Just try to use GroupRelationData with BasicViscolelasticRelationships.
      Cast size_t to int in pow(double,int) function to avoid ambiguity for gcc (compilation failled on one of my computer)
      Some tiny modifications for Mac OS X compatibility (Does not compil yet).
      Some forgotten tasks
      replace gcc-3.3 by gcc in the Makefile.macosx of mgpost

Václav Šmilauer (313):
      Move big news to NEWS, ready for release finally (?)
      Update INSTALL file from wiki (brief instructions only).
      1. Reimplement some loop-intensive functions from yade.utils in c++ for better performance (as yade._utils, imported into yade.utils automatically - transparent to the user)     2. Add poisson's ratio and Young's modulus estimation in yade.eudoxos based on linear regressions of position→displacement mapping along different axes     3. Rename Shop::ElasticWaveTimestepEstimate to Shop::PWaveTimeStep, wrapped in yade.utils
      1. Add python interface for blocking DOFs:     		b.phys.blockedDOFs=['z','rx','ry']     	It is friendlier than b.phys['blockedDOFs']=1<<2|1<<3|1<<4.     	The property is read-write.
      1. Add code for computing histogram of interaction directions in given plane in _utils.     2. This is code is used by yade.eudoxos.plotDirections() to create the actual (nice) figure.
      1. Skip (almost) exactly zero projections, implement masking of bodies.
      1. poisson and young estimator now works on a fractional part of the speciment     2. do not switch ui automatically if selected explcitly     3. body::maskOK to check mask
      1. eudoxos module cleanups, young estimator arg chages     2. fix harmless compiler warning in _utils.cpp
      1. add utility function to compute elastic energy within a volume (the dynamic_cast to NormalShearInteraction still fails; what is going on?)     2. add utils.fractionalBox, an AABB reduced to its fraction     3. fix fixmes in Force and Momentum about unused functions about to be deleted     4. plotting interaction direction histogram now works on contrained volume (to study boundary influence on the distribution)
      1. Beginning hijacking SpheresContactGeometry to hold more elaborate geometry characteristics, such as relative shear displacement. By default, those parameters are neither calculated nor displated (exactRot==False; must be set to True in ISphere2ISphere4SpheresContactGeometry to enable it). Test script is in scripts/exact-rot.py     2. Remove deprecated code from UniaxialStrainController     3. Add GLUtils to draw lines, text, numbers -- copid over from Shop     4. Add operator<< for Quatrnions (axis angle)     5. Fix energy calculation in volume (in _utils.cpp)     6. Other fixes here and there...
      1. The exactRot code is reasonably verified now to be functional, including rolling correction (SpheresContactGeometry::relocateContactPoints) and will used in brefcom soon.     2. Updated the "testing" script scripts/exact-rot.py, as a showcase as well.
      1. Remove GL things from Shop, moved to lib/opengl/GLUtils.hpp     2. Cleanup of SpheresContactGeometry code, rename exactRot to hasShear
      (I thought most of this was already commited?!)     1. Delete unused IS2IS4DistantSpheresContactGeometry (merged with IS2IS4SCG), adapt existing code     2. Adapt new facet code to updated SpheresContactGeometry (only superficially tested) so that     they can interact using BrefcomLaw; add scripts/exact-rot-facet.py to show that.     3. Fix a few missing loggers in others' commits.     4. SimulationController redraws if iteration changes (the +1 button would otherwise not cause redraw)     5. Remove cruft from Brefcom.     6. Fix inheritance (dynamic casts) of NormalShearInteraction and of BrefcomPhysParams     7. Remove cruft from UniaxialStrainer     8. Add some python code to compute stress from stored elastic energy.
      1. Move interaction direction distribution pie histograms to utils     2. Add plotting histogram of number of contacts to plotDirections()
      1. Omega().bodies.append can take list of bodies now (instead of just one body), returning list of added id's     2. utils.facet can take both tuples and lists for vertex coordinates
      1. Add NormalInteraction::normalForce and NormalShearInteraction::normalForce (moved up the hierarchy from ElasticContactInteraction) so that unbalancedForce can be calculated on any subclassed interaction type.     2. Adapt Brefcom for this.     3. Add Shop::unbalancedForce and utils.unbalancedForce     4. Add workaround for saving ipython history as suggested by http://lists.ipython.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-user/2008-September/005839.html     5. Fix AxialGravityEngine to register parent class attributes.
      1. Avoid compiler warning in optimized builds from pyOmega     2. Body containers now allocate the lowest possible ID for each added body. The old behavior was to allocate the first free ID greater than the ID of the body, if it was already set. Please let me know if this is critical for someone. We can do things like:
      1. 3d view now has by default a OSD with iteration number, simulation time and virtual time. This can be toggled (all combinations) by pressing 'D' (which used to mean toggling d+ynamic flag...?) and set also from python with GLView.timeMask='rvi' (Real,Virtual,Iteration) and so on.     2. Simulation player displays real time and wall clock loaded from db (insted of bogus values of system clock when the player is being run)     3. new periodic SnapshotEngine that takes snapshots of any GL view to numbered PNG files.     4. new function qt.makeSimulationVideo that makes video _while running the simulation_.     5. qt.createVideo renamed to qt.makePlayerVideo     6. Added Omega method to query computation duration.     7. An example of using qt.makeSimulationVideo is in new file scripts/simple-scene-video.py
      1. Add forgotten SnapshotEngine     2. BodyRedirectionVector always really find the lowest unused ID (the same for BodyAssocVector)     3. add Omega().interactions.clear() in python     4. Move the "Less than 500 bodies, moving possible" to LOG_INFO instead of on-screen since it disturbs videos taken during simulation...
      A few fixes in TriaxialTest:     1. radiusStdDev is a registered attribute parameter     2. skip unloading phase if sigmaLateralConfinement==sigmaIsoCompaction     3. new bool autoUnload, that controls automaticity of going from compaction to unloading; autocompressionActivation controls from unloading to loading.     Note: IFacet2IS4SCG is broken, but not yet fixed.
      1. TriaxialTest now takes readiusMean argument (by default negative, i.e. disabled); if >0, box size is scaled so that both requested porosity and mean size can be preserved.     2. Attempt to fix computation of stress from stored elastic energy.
      1. Fix adding empty engine if record wall stress interval <= 0 in TriaxialTest (bug introduced yesterday)
      1. Add Interaction::swapOrder(), for use in EngineUnits that want to avoid calling goReverse()     2. SnapshotEngine can sleep specified number of msecs after shot, which probably can avoid some hw problems (make_current failed in mesa, freezes etc)     3. InteractingFacet2IS4SCG now works "correctly" (not exactly physically, though) with shear     4. DynLibDispatcher should report names of classes if dispatch fails.
      1. Add InteractionGeometryMetaEngine::explicitAction and InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine::explicitAction for creating contacts manually using the dispatcher     2. add utils.createInteraction(id1,id2) that requests explicit transient interaction creation     3. Add sample ElasticContactLaw2 (in ElasticContactLaw.cpp) that uses new SpheresContactGeometry code and can be used for "persistent" (transient but not deleted by the collider) contacts.     4. Add Shop::applyForceAtContactPoint (applies contact force at contact point to both bodies (reversed for body2) and moments acting on their cenroids as well)     5. All the previous new functionality is demonstrated in scripts/chain-distant-interactions.py.
      1. Add Omega().reload()     2. Create map<string,string> Omega::memSavedSimulations, where simulations are saved if they begin with special sequence ":memory:" and can be loaded again, within lifetime of Omega.     3. Add Omega().tmpLoad() and Omega().tmpSave() that use the above mentioned thing.     4. add utils.readParamsFromTable that reads any python variables from text file (useful for automatic parametric studies)     5. Add less expensive routine for sontact point relocation in SpheresContactGeometry
      1. Separate player into two windows (controller and the 3d view); the controller may be hidden with ::hide() (and ::show()) or with Alt-H from the 3d view. This allows for correctly restoring 3d view size. Closing any of the two closes the player. Please log crashes, if any.     2. Update QtGUI-python.cpp: runPlayerSession
      1. Yade now runs TCP server at the first free port above 9000 (accessible from localhost only), which simulates python console. (let me know if you need this over network -- it is DANGEROUS, since someone can delete all your files etc without any authentication). The interpreter has its own namespace.
      1. Fix crasher (under special circumstances) in PersistentSAPCollider (deletion invalidating iterator)     2. PeriodicEngine now takes nDo and nDone attributes, limitng number of activations     3. Fix minor things is BrefcomDamageColorizer, add normalized damage to BrefcomPhysParams     4. Fix some indents in Triaxial
      Fix stupid sign mistake when applying contact force in brefcom.
      1. PythonTCPServer now generates random 6-letter cookie (password) at startup and authenticates all connections by that cookie.     It can be retrieved from yade.runtime.cookie
      1. Add Body().mask in python     2. Add PhysicalParameters().pos and .ori instead of ugly pp['se3'][:3] and pp['se3'][3:]     3. Add dmgPlane plot in brefcom     4. Do not delete renderer if we close the last view (loses all renderer settings)
      1. Add a quick implementation of bending and torsion code to SpheresContactGeometry     2. Update ElasticContactLaw2 to use that code; stiffnesses are hard-coded for now.     3. Update scripts/chain-distant-interactions.py to show that that code really works     4. Plot residual strength instead of damage in brefcom     5. Add some functions for spiral projections (not correctly working yet)     6. Fix missing std:: in DisplayParameters
      1. Add 2d weighted average smoothing abstract class and its specialization on symmetric gaussian kernel, with python glue of course.     2. Remove .gz support.     3. Fix some bugs in the spiral projection code.
      1. Fix errors preventing compilation due to missing TesselationWrapper.
      !! IMPORTANT !! Introduced new dependency on "python-numpy" package     (numpy/ndarrayobject.h header), which is now checked for by scons.     Tell me if this is not OK!
      1. Add initializers for all SpheresContactGeometry members, to avoid nan's in the .xml file     2. Add code for saving arbitrary python variables within the .xml file, see documentation on utils.saveVars() and utils.loadVars()     3. Fix error (hopefully) caused by dangling symlinks in the symlinked buildDir/include tree
      1. Fix algebraic typo in max distance check.
      1. Commit simple parametric study interface, documented at http://yade.wikia.com/index.php?title=ScriptParametricStudy and wrapper script to queue jobs, which is installed as yade-trunk-multi, yade-trunk-opt-multi and so on.     2. Examples of such parametric "study" added in scripts/multi.py and scripts/multi.table     3. MetaBody now create Omega().tags['id'] at initialization like '20081028T102950p15498' (date, time, pid) that is unique
      1. Changed colors to be random by default on utils.{sphere,box,facet}
      1. Make our intelligence-challenged deserializer finally gracefully handle nan, inf, -inf (arbitrary lower-upper case).     2. Fix crash in MembraneTest (leftover in the commit from testing, oh well)     3. Add TriaxialTest::fixedBoxDims to not scale selected box dimensions if sphere mean radius is given (example underway).
      1. experimental support for Real==long double (#defines QUAD_PRECISION, scons quad=1). long double is not necessarily quadruple precision (not on IA32, at least) though, but is still more precise than double. (search "long double" on wikipedia)     2. Some preparation to compile with -std=c++0x (not yet functional) WRT <boost/shared_ptr.hpp> and boost::shared_ptr vs. <memory> and std::shared_ptr     3. Fixed in yade-multi.     4. New direct oofenm exporter in yade.eudoxos.     5. Don't fiddle with termios in non-interactive sessions.
      1. Add INTEGER (besides FLOAT) to the list of wrapped c++ types in python. Fix type detection for long double     2. Fix Real->double conversions in GLDrawBssSweptSphereLineSegment.cpp
      1. Body().phys.refPos is directly accessible now (old way Body().phys['refSe3'[0:3]] still works, though)     2. Labeled engines are at load-time or when Omega().engines are modified assigned to variables __builtins__.label;       for example
      Add forgotten file.
      1. Add linear templated interpolation function working on 2 lists, t and values     2. Add InterpolatingRotationEngine that changes rotation speed as given by value table     3. Lower info about starting python thread to debug message only.
      1. Rename REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE(class,bool) to REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE_GENERIC, add two macros REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE and REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE_FUNDAMENTAL. Changed all uses accordingly.     2. Added REGISTER_CLASS_AND_BASE(class,base) which performs REGISTER_CLASS_NAME and REGISTER_BASE_CLASS_NAME at once.     3. Added REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES (not trailing 'S'), expanding to void registerAttributes(){...}, and REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES_WITH_BASE, which prepends call to baseClass::registerAttributes() (specified as the first argument).
      1. Added Se3Interpolator engine, with scripts/test/Se3Interpolator.py     2. Added from math import * to PythonUI_rc.py so that math functions are readily accessible everywhere     3. Implemented stopStrain in UniaxialStrainControlledTest     4. other small fixes
      1. Modify REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES macro so that it work with or without base class given. Change all headers in core to use that. It should help us if we ever make the transition to boost::serialization.     2. User REGISTER_CLASS_AND_BASE instead of REGISTER_CLASS_NAME and REGISTER_BASE_CLASS in core and at a few other places.
      1. Removed cerr garbage from glviewer (use LOG_DEBUG if needed)
      1. Fix warnings in GLViewer     2. Add (35.4%)-style counter if stopAtIteration is set to the OSD in gl view     3. Add utils.downCast to downcast object to its derived class and copying all attributes.     4. Add utils.SpherePWaveTimeStep to compute critical dt from a few parameters only     5. Add routine to compute overall kinetic energy to Shop (indirectly to utils as well)     6. Add routine to sum torque (momentum) with respect to an axis from forces and torques on given set of bodies.
      Fix typo (compilation error in debug mode) in Shop::kineticEnergy
      1. Fix a bug in rotation ode in SpheresContactGeometry. Now the code gives the same results as almost-for-sure-correct FEM code regarding strain computation.     2. Add label attribute to StandAloneEngine (inherits from Engine)
      omg
      (code cleanup, no functional changes)
      Exit once the simulation finishes; do not rely on simulation exiting itself.
      1. SpiralEngine that does both rotation and translation along the same axis     2. InterpolatingSpiralEngine for variable rotation+translation speed (replaces InterpolationgRotationEngine)     3. scripts/test-spiral.py for rudimentary functionality testing.
      1. Un-disallow (bug) having all dimensions scalable in triaxial if particle radius is fixed.     2. Don't record anything by default to file in UniaxialStrainer (only useful for debugging)
      1. Add a few functions for integrating piecewise-linear functions in new module yade.linterpolation
      1. fix damage colorizer (removed dynamic_cast causing segfaults on non-spheres)     2. InterpolatingSpiralEngine now takes bool wrap rather than Real period.     3. qt.makePlayerVideo takse startWait argument, which waits for Backspace before starting (useful for setting up the view manually); postLoadHook gets run afterwards now.
      1. Add algorithm for pushing sphere always to the same side when in contact with facet, even under extreme stress where the sphere geometrically passes to the other side.     2. Add bool SpheresContactGeometry::initContactOnPositiveFacetSide for that     3. Add test/demo script for that.     4. Re-enabled GLDrawSphere::glutUse (cosurgi?)     5. Renamed yade.runtime.args to argv, to be consistent with sys.argv     6. Allow passing sys.argv (arguments to scripts) through QtGUI as well
      1. Fix clip plane orientation inversion as well as wheel normal movement.     2. Clip planes not displayed at all unless one of the clip planes is being manupulated.
      1. Unbreak bad type (list) for sys.argv[0], broken recently     2. Color bodies by residual strength rather than damage parameter (smoother)     3. Make player messages (maybe) better formatted
      omg...
      1. Make player reuse existing renderer if there is one (allows setting Draw_mask etc before running player)     2. Add initRun parameter to PeriodicEngine (false by default), to run at the very fist run.
      1. Make BrefcomDamageColorizer run at 0th iteration as well     2. Make player set stopAtIter to last iteration in db so that percentage is displayed in the output.
      Fix previous commit, overlooked. sorry.
      1. Number lines in parameter table for multijobs from 1 (as text editors do)     2. Print short summary at the end of job log (when started, when finished, exit status, duration, commandline)
      1. Fix logic typo in QtGUI (warning when there shouldn't be and vice versa)
      1. logarithmic strain for Brefcom.     2. change sphere-facet algorithm such that it works on corners. Maybe no longer necessary, but it doesn't hurt now. scripts/test-sphere-facet-corner.py as provided by sega demonstrates that.     3. "from __future__ import division" in python init such that 3/2==1.5 and 3//2=1 (is default since python 2.6)     4. Global GL lock to avoid crashes/freezes with GL accessed from multiple threads concurrently. scripts/gl-test.py (which used to crash) now works with one view;     5. Properly lock/unlock on all gl ops in QtGUI-python.cpp, like setting view direction, resizing etc.     6. Fix wrong assertion in SQLite player     7. add Omega().resetTime to reset iteration number, virtual and real time.     8. Changed utils.loadVars/saveVars code to be more reliable.     9. Added utils.aabbExtrema2d
      1. Lock GL when closing view. Seems to fix crashes / delays at exit
      1. Contact sphere-facet must be deleted by the constitutive law once created. Let me know if that is a problem -- I think it is the way it should be in the future everywhere, though.     2. Fixes for boost 1.37 (boost::thread not fully compatible)     3. utils.basidDEMEngines (not tested yet)     4. Fix warning in GroupRelationData     5. add march switch to scons ('native' is default, but not supported by older compilers)     6. Prepend default CXXFLAGS so that user-defined ones (like warning suppression) come after the default ones and override those.
      1. Tentative fix for newer scons, which links empty files (dummy plugins) with plain gcc and doesn't find default c++ libs to link with.
      1. File not needed.
      1. Beautify no-debug code in main     2. SpiralEngine now saves angle it has turned so far     3. Remove failing assertion from IFacet2ISphere4SCG (why it fails? it was a (I->isReal&&I->interactionGeometry)||(!I->isReal&&!I->interactionGeometry)...)     4. Improve the utils.spiralproject function to specify period (moderately tested, but seems to work)     5. Adjust locks in GLViewer. Fixes my crashes on nvidia for both player and 3d view (didn't dare to try 2nd view). Next step will be to move this lock to Omega and lock it when loading/resetting simulation etc.     6. Change theora video quality to 63 (maximum) instead of medium 32 in utils.encodeVideoFromFrames. Makes the video about 3x bigger.
      Two BIG changes:
      1. Add ef2_Spheres_Brefcom_BrefcomLaw, is faster (!)     2. Fix locking in Omega, we don't get crashes when loading simulation with the 3D view enabled anymore (please report any further crashes in OpenGLRenderingEngine, that should be fixed)     3. Automatic update of Doxygen configuration file     4. Dem3DofContactGeometry, which should be in near future parent of SpheresContactGeometry and other new geometries providing normal and shear strains (SphereFacetContactGeometry, in my mind)     5. Add convenience function to apply force to contact point between two particles.
      (remove no-warn for c++0x since that flag is not known to gcc-3.4)
      1. Add possibility to change container types from python (for benchmarks) -- code not yet tested!     2. Possible optimization in PhysicalActionVectorVector, now disabled.
      collider mistake hotfix
      1. Make triaxial stop if !autoCompressionActivation and already unloaded. If this breaks something, please let me know, we can do it otherwise, but, for Cundall's sake, can we keep the same behavior for at least 6 months??     2. SpatialQuickSortCollider will not delete real contacts, even if bodies don't collide.     3. Remove redundant attribute registration from SpheresContactGeometry
      fix typo in collider
      1. removed persistentInteraction from most places; they are still present in MetaBody, but not serialized any more, most importantly (avoids warnings) and not GL-drawn.     2. Plugin loading loginc completely changes, the underlying macro YADE_PLUGIN has still the same interface. We used __attribute__((constructor)), __attribute__((visibility("internal"))) and anonymous namespace magic to get there. This will make it possible to put multiple plugins to a single shared library without touching the source, only fiddling with SConscript's.     3. PythonUI is interactive by default (it was not?? weird.)
      1. Add new non-generic Bex container. For non-optimized build, it increased the speed by about 11% (9:35 vs. 8:49) as compared to PhysicalActionVectorVector.
      Users willling to go with the slower PhysicalActionContainer can compile with scons CXXFLAGS=-DNO_BEX now to get the old behavior.
      1. Adapted TriaxialTest and ElasticContactLaw to BexContainer (switchable at compile-time).     2. Adapter GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper to BexContainer (GlobalStiffnessCounter code put to a function inside this one, hence that engine is not needed anymore).     3. Adapted Shop::Bex to BexContainer (probably not needed anymore?)     4. Exception is thrown in PhysicalActionVectorVector is used && built with BEX_CONTAINER (would most likely crash anyway).     5. transientInteractions and persistentInteractions are only references to MetaBody::interactions now. Removed extra loops in InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine and InteractionGeometryMetaEngine.     6. Remove including qglviewer into miniWm3, as it breaks compilation if using miniWm3 separately from yade (for testing purposes).
      1. Define Janek's functions to convert from/to QGLViewer vector where they are used.
      1. Add BexContainer (same interface, but separate implementation) in openMP flavor.     2. openmp=0 is the default for scons now (for some time), since openMP BexContainer gives about 7% slowdown and thus is not useful before at least some engines are parallelized as well.     3. Removed getting references to Force/Torque from BexContainer, since that breaks concurrency. Instead, addForce/addTorque must be used. If you need to read back with getForce/getTorque, you have to call sync() (expensive!!) beforehand, which will compute summary values for all bodies; if you forget, exception will be thrown. Note that sync() is invalidated at next write operation.     4. Adapted a few constitutive laws and other engines for the changes mentiones here.
      1. Add time-profiling classes. See http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Speed_profiling_using_TimingInfo_and_TimingDeltas_classes for details. It is accessible from python as well.     2. SimulationController no longer asks for output format. It just uses XML, the only available one.     3. Engine, EngineUnit have timingInfo member and pointer to optional timingDeltas. Timing is disabled by default, but it may still have some overhead in the order <1% perhaps (will test)
      1. Forgotten file with yade.timing.stats() that pretty-prints some numbers.
      1. Move all container to core, remove linking with them since it is not necessary     2. Fix things so that everything compiles (at least) both with and without BexContainer     3. Parallelize ConstitutiveLawDispatcher, InteracionPhysicsMetaEngine and InteractionGeometryMetaEngine with openMP if enabled on command-line     4. Make InteractionVecMap default container for interactions; necessary for parallel code.
      1. New InteractionDispatchers class that has one common loop for InteractionGeometryMetaEngine, InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine and ConstitutiveLawDispatcher. It can be used from python like this:
      1. Adapt ForceEngine to BexContainer     2. Add BEX_CONTAINER and YADE_OPENMP flags to be reported by -h.
      1. Add two more forgotten headers. They are not used anywhere, though, and will be removed later.
      1. Enhancement of utils.box from Marco.
      1. Make Shop load 4/5/6 columns text files for spheres (and skip 5-cols)     2. Change evaluation of args in readParamsFromTable to be able to pass strings better (single quotes) and consistently     3. Parameters passed as env. vars by yade-multi are prefixed with !     4. fix typo in timing for resetting timers.
      1. Make the yade-multi scheduler multithread-aware.     2. Add the collider performance test as example     3. added utils.replaceCollider(anotherCollider) for convenience     4. added Omega().isChildClassOf(classNameChild,classNameParent)
      1. Fix collider-perf (TriaxialTest has hardcoded dt=0.001 !!!!), set timestep by hand at first     2. Fix Shop:: loading spheres from file (regression from yesterday)     3. Add functorCache to Interaction and to InteractionDispatchers. About 5% improvement, but not yet finished.     4. Add DynLibDispatcher::getFunctor2D     5. Add BexContainer::sync() to other places in triaxial (thrown otherwise)
      1. Fix old rename of runtime.args to runtime.argv in default-test.py. Should run OK now.
      1. Fix for the compile error in snow for OrthogonalPlaneFit3. It still misses pkg/snow/Engine/ElawSnowLayersDeformation.cpp in the repo. Compile with exclude=...,snow as workaround.
      1. Rename BroadInteractor to Collider.     2. Move some part of the contact logic to this common base class. The Collider::handleExistingInteraction is subject to discussion and not yet used.
      1. Small fix in the collider code.
      1. Remove SAPCollider completely     2. Make yade log4cxx 0.10 compatibile     3. Other minor fixes
      1. Fix linking of realtime-rigidbody WRT PersistentSAPCollider
      1. change default xiShear to 0 instead of NaN (is not used anyway)     2. Fix linking of mass-spring in cliean build
      1. Fix #include's that include files not in the current source directory via "".     2. Add scripts/linkdeps.py that can automatically determine what plugin links to what other plugins, which can be once used for configurable monolithic/pluggable builds etc.
      1. Fix crashed in TriaxialTest introduced by me a few days ago (referencing engine before being created)     2. Add simple (working?) memory usage query to utils and collider perf test.
      1. Fixed collider performance benchmark     2. Added script to generate graph from log files (like http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace)
      1. Added SpheresContactGeometry::updateShearForce, will be used (not activated though yet) by ElasticContactLaw and other.
      hotfix related to last commit
      1. Initial checkout for the DemXDofGeom classes (will contain the hasShear code from SpheresContactGeometry and more eventually).
      1. Preliminary version for sphere-facet collisions with total formulation (moderately tested).     2. Same for sphere-sphere collision.     3. test script for facet-sphere collision geometry.
      1. Use local foreach.hpp if not found in the system     2. Use local file defining boost::python::len for boost<1.34
      1. remove explicit linkage to boost_python in gui/SConscript
      Forgotten empty file.
      1. Remove logger from ClassFactory     2. Cleanup logging stuff in main (use constructor function, among other)     3. Cleanup system exit from python in PythonUI_rc.py     4. Add SpheresContactGeometry::updateShear that can be optionally used with ElasticContactLaw to update shear displacement instead of updating shearForce. triax-identical-results.py show quite large difference between both implementations, but I am not able to tell which one is correct. scripts/test/shear.py shown almost no difference for 2-sphere scenarios, modulo differences at 15th decimal place or so.     5. Remove debug output from BexContainer     6. Remove warning about meniscus data from CapillaryCohesiveLaw (warning is given in postProcessAttributes now, i.e. iff the class is actually used)     7. Add logger to snow.     8. Removed shear computation code in ElasticContactLaw, use SpheresContactGeometry::updateShearForce.     9. Fix scons deprecation warnings
      1. Add functions to augment forces/torques in BexContainer.
      1. Remove some garbage from SpheresContactGeometry     2. Verify that SCG_SHEAR doesn't alter behavior if ElasticContactLaw::useShear is false     3. Implement SCG_SHEAR for sphere-box interactions     4. sphere-box interactions no longer call goReverse, but swap interaction order instead, as facets do.     5. Fix triax-idnetical-results.py to reload generated initial config to avoid rounding issues of sphere coords in text file.
      Minifix: link core with librt (clock_gettime) for platforms that require it
      1. Add rate-dependent damage to normal and viscoplasticity to shear components of Brefcom (not yet tested, just compiles); other cleanups there.
      1. add addF and addT to legacy ActionContainer
      Add label attribute to engine units. Python wrapper updated.
      1. Rate-dependent fixes (more to come) in brefcom.
      1. Remove MetaBody::physicalActions if compiling with BEX_CONTAINER (default)     2. Make everything work with both BexContainer and deprecated PhysicalActionContainer     3. Change PhysicalActionDamper, PhysicalActionDamperUnit, PhysicalActionApplier and PhysicalActionApplierUnit to dispatch only according to PhysicalParameters (not PhysicalAction anymore). That means that only one unit will be called for each body and that NewtonsMomentumLaw has to do the job of NewtonsForceLaw as well (same for CundallNonViscousMomentumDamping).     4. Fix (finally) defaultDt computation in TriaxialTest (forgotten assignment to defaultDt in the GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper)     5. Fix (finally?) timestep manipulation form within the QtGUI. If reloading the same file, timestep settings will be preserved, otherwise those saved in the XML are used.
      1. Create ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw that has the ElasticContactLaw algorithm     2. ElasticContactLaw now merely calls ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw.     3. TriaxialTest::parallel controls whether to use InteractionDispatchers or not.     4. Added examples/triax-perf to show the impact of that. Also see http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Triaxial_Test_Parallel     5. Fix a few compilation issues.     6. Flush stdout before exiting from main, so that in case of crash upon exit (log4cxx?) we have all messages output.
      1. Hotfix for 2 issues with ElasticContactLaw
      1. Remove all traces of physical actions:
      1. Remove Shop::Bex (no longer necessary)     2. Add InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine for Roger (not yet tested!)
      1. Fix linking of ForceEngine with interpolation     2. Random rate-dependent things.     3. Typo in BexContainer docs
      1. A few fixes in Brefcom.     2. Make python wrapper correctly handle long long attributes.     3. Added test script for InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine
      1. MAJOR change in python syntax (backwards-compatible, though): through small bit of very dirty code,  classes can be instantiated as python objects with keyowrd arguments, i.e. instead of
      1. cleanup UniaxialStrainer code, add vars to control length of the acceleration phase and the ability to set absolute speed     2. EngineUnits within InteractionDispatchers can be labeled and accessed from python now.     3. A few minor things in the plot module
      1. Remove cruft from brefcom, a few fixes there     2. Add gnuplot grid to gnuplot by default     3. Fix speed in USCT     4. Fix InteractionDispatchers traversal in pyOmega
      1. Fix weird python problem if LIBS is not defined by distuils (?)
      1. Add working version of facet adjacency finder (to get their mutual angle at edge)
      1. Parallelize initial bound filling in PersistentSAPCollider. Gives almost 3x speedup for the first step.     2. Fix missing headers so that it compiles with g++-4.4 (in QGLViewer)     3. FacetTopologyAnalyzer works (not tested extensively), questions of where to put topology data for InteractingFacet (will be raised on yade-dev)     4. Test script for FacetTopologyAnalyzer.
      1. Remove leftover var in PersistentSAPCollider
      1. Add preliminary gnuplot plots merging facility to yade-multi     2. Fix yade.log module so that it also works without log4cxx (and gives 1 warning)     3. Switch to new syntax in scripts/plot.py
      1. Fix race condition in brefcom (omp critical section)     2. Remove -ffast-math from optimized build, since NaNs do not work properly (e.g. isnan(NaN)==false!)
      1. Fix bug in FacetTopologyAnalyzer algorithm     2. Add angle info to InteractingFacet (not yet used)     3. Add triangulated sphere test for FacetTopoloyAnalyzer to facet-topo.py     4. Fixes in rate-dep in brefcom
      1. Add approximate viscosity equations to brefcom (not working)     2. Fixes in yade-multi
      1. Finish implementation of Dof3DofGeom_FacetSphere (with plastic slip as well)     2. Adapt Brefcom optionally to Dem3DofGeom     3. Add d0fixup to SpheresContactGeometry to get correct normal strain in sphere-facet contact with fictive sphere     (zero for sphere-sphere)     4. Finish FacetTopologyAnalyzer; angle usage in Dem4DofGeom_FacetSphere not yet tested.
      1. Remove cruft from UniaxialStrainer, add the ability to set initial velocities to suppress inertia at the simulation beginning     2. Jobs in yade-multi can be automatically named after variables suffixed with !     3. yade-multi now shows and updates automatically some statistic on localhost:9080 using http
      1. Finish Dem3Dof for both spheres and facets, migrate Brefcom. Removing stuff from SpheresContactGeometry is on schedule, once thorough testing is finished.     2. Fix attribute inheritance for a few engine units     3. Add ef2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_ElasticLaw, which works like ElasticContactLaw (but faster ;-) )     4. Remove BrefcomLaw, keep just the constitutive law as functor. Adapt sample generators for that.     5. Add hydrostatic confinement to brefcom (isoPrestress), remove viscApprox.     6. Add interface for querying and setting (doesn't work yet) number of openMP threads     7. Job description is taken from columns suffixed with ! or by combining all parameters     8. Add function for plotting yeild surface of brefcom to the eudoxos module     9. Oofem export now uses reference (starting) positions of particles as it should     10. Add "-" before profile name when generating default variant suffix in scons (which is expected)
      Fix comp9ilation error for Janek.
      1. Add python wrapper for clumps, see scripts/test/clump.py on how to use it (O.bodies.appendClumped)     2. Fix clump support in NewtonsDampedLaw (damping is quite wrong, it seems...; Bruno, any ideas on that?)     3. Move clump to pkg-dem (even though it depends on extra/Shop)     4. Remove absolute shear computation from SpheresContactGeometry, as Dem3Dof works fine now and Brefcom will not use SCG anymore; adapt a few other classes to that; remove ElasticContactLaw2 that was using it.     5.
      1. Warn in --version if -ffast-math was used
      1. Fixing bug in TriaxialCompressionEngine (introduced by luc apparently).
      Big changes:
      Handle boundingVolume-less bodies gracefully in InsertionSortCollider
      1. Add utils.regularSphereOrthoPack by Anoton
      Forgotten showcase.
      1. Add InteractionContainer::requestErase to hint colliders that wouldn't otherwise see !isReal interactions.     2. Use this logic in InsertionSortCollider, PersistentSAPCollider, SpatialQuickSortCollider (noop in the last one)     3. Add InsertionSortCollider::sortThenCollide to make it behave as non-persistent collider (for debugging only?)     4. Add Interaction::reset() that has common initialization code.     5. Assign zero inertia to utils.facet (better than uninitialized binary garbage)     6. Fix contact logic in Brefcom, finally I get the same results with InsertionSortCollider as with SpatialQuickSortCollider on large simulation (more fixes to come)     7. Do not install pkg-config; fixes compilation error reported by the build bot.
      1. Use bitfield instead of bools in InsertsionSortCollider     2. Revert accidental changes in insertion-sort-collider.py     3. Add function for using renamed classes from python with warning
      Getting rid of the Brefcom name, classes renamed as follows (moving files around  will follow)
      1. Add logic to scons to delete files that will not be installed in this run but are on-disk. This should make it unnecessary to remove files by hand. In the same way, disable implicit target cache which was making problems if files shuffle around.     2. Remove Brefcom* files, move to pkg/dem/ConcretePM.?pp. (not sure what other place, since it contains Engines, DataClasses etc in one file that I would refuse to break.).     3. Add detailed comments on ConcretePM to the ConcretePM.hpp     4. Remove extra/usct, moveUniaxialStrainer and put to pkg/dem; move SimpleScene from extra to pkg/dem     5. Remove core/yadeExceptions.*     6. Remove Preferences::dynLibDirectores and Preferences::version. Omega now recursively searches the lib directory for plugins and loads them. preferences.xml has only defaultGUILibName now. Finally. Remove baseDirs and other cruft from DynLibManager.
      2 forgotten files (separated from UniaxialStrainer before)
      1. Fix hopefully last relict of pkg-config     2. Degrade deleting non-existent interaction from fatal erro to warning only (not sure where that can come from, though.)
      Solve the cause of nonexistent interactions being deleted (after O.interactions.clear()). Make warning fatal error again.
      1. Remove Interaction::isNew, Interaction::isReal. Add Interaction::isReal() which test for presence of _both_ interactionGeometry and interactionPhysics and Interaction::isFresh() which checks the interaction creation timestamp against current iteration. Updated all code for that. Please verify that your stuff works, it is possible I made some mistakes!     2. All code saying isReal=false replaced by interaction->requestErase(id1,id2)     3. make requestErase thread-safe     4. Add interace for traversing interactions pending erase (template)     5. Add TriaxialTest::noFiles and TriaxialCompressionEngine::noFiles to not generate any files (default: off)     6. Add predicate utils.ptInAABB(p,minPt,maxPt)     7. utils.spheresToFile return number of spheres written (instead of None)     8. Add examples/concrete/pack to generate packing; other stuff in concrete will follow, with simplified version of the cpm model in ConcretePM.
      1. Syntax fixes in ConcretePM model     2. Interactions will be deleted also if the ye4xist, but geometry functor fails (returns false)     3. Add utils.approxSectionArea, utils.spheresFromFileUnixial (get some parameters useful for uniaxial tests from the sphere packing, such as cross-section, principal axis, etc)     4. Add lib/computational-geometry/Hull2d.hpp for computing convex hull in 2d using Graham scan algorithm (I know it is in CGAL already, but I don't want to depend on that commercial stuff)     5. Remove some unused stuff from utils.
      1. Add epsNPl to Cpm     2. Replace vector<body_id_t> by Vector2<body_id_t> and make it properly serializable (should be faster)     3. Add function to compute forces on interactions crossing plane.     4. Replace custom xcombine function by itertools.product in grid sphere packing
      Fixes and cleanups in the CPM code.
      Add new 'feature' to scons called openGL, which is on by default.     Qt3 GUI will not be built without openGL.     YADE_OPENGL is defined in openGL-enabled builds.     Sconscript files adapted to skip GL plugins or GL parts of plugins.
      1. Fix missing libs for linkage     2. Fix a few typos
      1. Don't link core with glut (is there a reason for that?)
      Do not include X11 headers if without opengl
      1. Move all python modules to PREFIX/lib/yadeSUFFIX/py/yade instead of */gui/yade     2. Add pack module for generating regular packings (thanks to Anton Gladky for his ideas & code)     3. Add _packPredicates module for solid inclusion testing.     4. Update regular-sphere-pack.py to test new packing features.
      Remove leftover reularSpheresOrthoPack from utils. Is in yade.pack now.
      Add pack.inHyperboloid predicate. Should be useful for cylindric specimen in uniaxial tension, but with the middle part having smaller diameter. Added to the test script as well.
      1. Fix (hopefully) clump damping     2. Remove unused code from InsertionSortCollider     3. Make SimulationController NOT change timestep (rounding) by just opening it (!!)     4. Fix paths in PythonUI and lib/SConscript for $PREFIX/yade$SUFFIX/py/yade instead of $PREFIX/yade$SUFFIX/gui/yade
      1. Add resetting interactionGeometry and interactionPhysics to Interaction::reset(), as it should be...     2. Small things in CPM     3. Add GaussAverage.data method to python (for debugging and plotting)
      Include Python.h in PythonRunnerFilter. Build this plugin only with EMBED_PYTHON.
      A few changes to allow run primarily python with qt3 on the top of that (open, close etc as needed). This paves way to running main yade process in python ;-) (just kidding, for now)
      1. Handle groupMasks of bodies in InteractionDispatchers directly (not in geometry functors etc).     2. Fixes for qt3 started from within python     3. Add Body().dynamic flag to the wrapper, instead of using Body()['isDynamic'] all the time.
      Anton's new things: axis-aligned ellipsoid predicate and fix in pack.regularHexa.
      1. Add external euclid.py module (suggested by Anton, thanks!) to our installation
      1. Propose *.sqlite ending for saved simulations instead of * in the player
      Fix error-tolerant law which uses no interactionPhysics: add void Interaction physics in the geometry functor if returning true, to make Interaction::isReal return true. (Shouldn't we remove ErrorTolerant...? Does it have some serious use?)
      1. Remove constructor priority for log4cxx to avoid syntax unsupported by gcc<=4.0.     2. Remove some commented cruft from FrictionLessElasticContactLaw
      1. Add boolean operators on solid predicates (&,|,^,-), shown in scripts/test/regular-sphere-pack.py     2. Add notch predicate (not functional yet)     3. Add utils.alignedFacetBox to create hollow box from facets. Shown in new file scripts/test/facet-box.py
      1. Update simulation filename in controller periodically     2. Fix notInNotch predicate, use infinite AABB for unbounded solids and raise exception in the packing generator if such is encountered.     3. Add notch to the head of regular-sphere-pack.py guy
      1. Add checks for GTS (optional)     2. Add pyGTS to our tree (built only if needed), since no packages are available.
      1. Fix corner case in InsertionSortCollider related to instability of std::sort (quicksort) and bodies having the same upper and lower bounds (facet in the xy plane, for example). Thanks to Anton for providing the crasher.
      Fix feature macro definitions (typos)
      1. Add GTS surface predicate     2. Add example of sphere horse falling onto facet horse in scripts/test/gts.py (try it!)     3. Predicate difference now takes padding in the inverse sense for the second predicate (logical)     4. Attempt to enable lightning on facets (no effect :-( )
      1. Add coarsened horse geometry for the example gts.py
      1. Rename ef2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_ElasticLaw to Law2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_Elastic (in scripts as well)
      1. Make virtual methods on pack.Predicate work in python (inGtsSurface, for instance). Add scripts/test/gts-operators.py to show that.     2. Move scripts/test/gts.py to gts-horse.py     3. Add a few functions to pack for constructing triangulated revolution surfaces from meridians.
      1. Padding support (though slow and not very precise) for pack.inGtsSurface
      1. Fix crashers in InteractingMyTetrahedron* classes (introduced by me when updating interaction logic)     2. Reimplement inGtsSurface in c/c++ which makes it faster due to pygts interface limitations (addressed on pygts mailing list meanwhile), but is dirty programming.     3. Set CCOMSTR to correspond to CXXCOMSTR in SConstruct (to show nice line when compiling c source file, for pygts)     4. Set good-looking timestep in the TetrahedronsTest generator
      1. Add triaxial packing generator, with optional memoization to sqlite database to avoid generating packing if there are suitable ones (same parameters/scalable to same parameters) available. Sample script will be provided soon. This allows for filling arbitrary (gts-defined, for example) volumes with irregular, high-quality sphere packing.     2. Add python-wrapped class SpherePack for manipulating sphere packings (loading, saving, spatial transformations, iterating)     3. Add shared_ptr<MetaBody> Omega::rootBodyAnother to be used with Omega().switchWorld()     4. Move some stuff from gui/py to lib/py, which is more logical hopefully     5. If negative value is specified for TriaxialTest::thickness, wall thickness will correspond to the mean sphere radius (avoids spheres going through the walls during compaction for some radii)
      1. Add automatic converter from python::tuple to Vector3r and vice versa. Wrapped functions can take/return Vector3r directly instead of manual conversion. Clean code that had to do that. Let me know if something breaks, the changes should not touch any python code.     2. Some preliminary work on wrapping Vector+Quaternion classes in python via py++ (not enabled, just the files are there)     3. Add forgotten _packSphere.cpp, thanks to Vincent for reporting.
      1. Add scripts/test/gts-traix-pack.py to demonstrate triaxial packing generator.
      Remove useless include in GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.
      1. Fix STUPID (my fault, sorry!!) mistake in setting Interaction::iterMadeReal, which cause ElasticContactLaw to function wrong. It concerns a few other contact laws calling isFresh, which would return true as well. Sorry again.
      1. Shuffling stuff around, moving most python things to py/     2. Wrapping Vector3r, Quaternionr and Vector2r in python directly, see scripts/wm3-wrap.py     3. Change the way utils.box, utils.sphere and utils.facet works: arguments to physical parameters are passed as keywords, not as dictionary now (update your old code by passing **dict instead of dict as the last argument)     4. Fix a bug with useShear, now getting almost identical results for triaxial again.     5. Preliminary Triaxial::facetWalls, to be able to used Dem3DofGeom with Triaxial. (not fully functional yet)     6. TriaxialStressController::thickness is -1 by default now (get thickness from box width), as 0 is real value for Facets. Doesn't change beahvior in any way.
      1. Update triax-perf.py     2. Add Omega().tmpToString returning string of :memory: saved simluation
      1. add yade.plot.resetData(), which unlike reset() resets just data     2. Add scripts/test/compare-identical.py to run 2 simulations at the same time and check at every step (configurable) if they differ or not.     3. Add active=active line to GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper, which for some reason causes two same simulations to be the same. Any explanation someone??
      1. Add forgotten py/SConscript (sorry!)
      1. Fix absolute path generated by py++
      1. Dump XML in ConcretePM in case of problems (nan's)     2. InteractingFacet::postProcessAttributes gives FATAL message if there are coincident vertices     3. Update triax-perf, add script and openoffice sheet to make table     4. InsertionSortCollider is used in TriaxialTest always (not only with fast) now.
      1. Change prototype of Engine::isActivated() to Engine::isActivate(MetaBody*)     2. Add maxVelocitySq to NewtonsDampedLaw for analysis purposes     3. Add BoundingVolumeMetaEngine::sweepTime and ::sweepDist to sweep bounding volume by given predicted motion over time or by given absolute distance.     4. Add strided run support to InsertionSortCollider (using sweeping)     5. Add scripts/test/collider-stride-triax.py to play with the strategies of sweeping based on strides     6. Add O.interactions.countReal()
      1. Fix collider-stride.py to match changed parameters. (it is quite useless now, anyway
      1. Make NewtonsDampedLaw compute maxVlocitySq at every step anew.     2. Make InsertionSortCollider find NewtonsDampedLaw and get max speed from there. Together with InsertionSortColider::sweepLength, this makes stride adapted automatically to maxVelocitySq; this will described at http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Insertion_Sort_Collider_Stride.     3. Update test script for that.
      1. Handle clumps in a better way in NewtonsDampedLaw (only if asked by the clump itself) -- future parallelization work. (related to bug #398086)     2. InsertionSortCollider now knows when to run based on maximum distance the fastest body could have travelled. (It is actually the physical meaning of sweepDistance). Handle varying maxVelocitySq in a constitent way.     3. Add InteractionContainer::serializeSorted to sort interactions by id1 and id2 before serializing (useful for comparing XML files). Added Interaction::operator< to compare 2 interactions in that way.     4. Fix openMP strategy in InteractionDispatchers to "guided" (as per https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/omp-schedule-strategy)
      1. Remove doc/removed, it is in SVN history     2. Tune debian scripts to install docs+examples+scripts instead of headers (targets https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/398174, but not yet finished)     3. Add depends on python-numpy instead of python-scientific packages for debian     4. Add ../py directory to doxygen (targets bug #398190)
      1. Change NewtonsDampedLaw to a StandAloneEngine     2. add .updateExistingKeys (perhaps should be updateExistingAttributes) to all python-wrapped yade objects, which will change only existing attributes from given dictionary     3. Adapt STLImporterTest to new nicer syntax.
      1. Add virtual destructors to all EngineUnits so that they can by dynamic_cast'ed to. This fixes possible crash from python, bug #398255     2. Rename updateExistingKeys to updateExistingAttrs, add updateAttrs.     3. Add forgotten script to demonstrate predicate operators     4. The default debug level is -ggdb2 (instead of -ggdb3). Libs are about 60% in size and still give the same debug information.
      1. Rename scons option arcs to PGO (profile=guided optimizations)     2. Install only binaries by default (no docs, must be requested from cmd line via path)
      1. Various fixes related to generating debian packages
      1. Fix EngineUnits linkage for SImpleViscoelasticRelationships
      1. Add velocity binning for collision optimization: requires cooperation of NewtonsDampedLaw, BoundingVolumeMetaEngine and InsertionSortCollider.     2. Remove time-based sweeping from BoundingVOlumeMetaEngine.     3. QtGUI doesn't show annoying warning when run from python session anymore.
      1. Parallelized NewtonsDampedLaw (scales very well)     2. Parallelized VelocityBins     3. Add const modifier to BodyContainer::size     4. Add virtual dtors to PhysicalAction{Damper,Applier}Unit (for dynamic_cast'ing)
      1. Move NewtonsDampedLaw to StandAloneEngine directory     2. Add omp critical to ConcretePM     3. Remove SphericalDEMSimulator
      1. Add sweepLength to TriaxialTest if fast==true     2. Remove euclid from the pack module, since we use wrapped wm3 now.     3. Add _packObb.cpp to compute minimal oriented bounding box on cloud of points     4. inGtsSurface predicate with triaxialPack will work on the minimum OBB     5. Add check for engine to prevent crash as per https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/399810     6. Enhance the pack.inSpace predicate to work as expected. Custom center can be given to the ctor
      1. Fix non-tuple in graph specification     2. Allow plotting agains the y2 axis, after a special parameter '|||'.
      1. Remove mutex from requestErase (should be verified to compile on non-openMP machine!)     2. Add mutex to PhysicalParameters, so that body state can be locked while updating from the interaction loop.     3. Add linking with EngineUnits to Tetra (thans Emanuelle)
      why..??
      1. Adapt simple-scene-graph.py to new instance syntax     2. Add support to y2axis to saved gnuplot plots     3. Change interface for yade.plot.addData to take **kw instead of straight dict (still backwards-compatible)
      1. Do not use REGISTER_ATTRIBUTE anymore, use REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES instead everywhere. This generates (in addition to serialization code) also some python code and makes python independent on the yade serialization framework (Janek, if you want to try boost::serialization, I have no objections now).
      1. Remove garbage from doc     2. Instruct getopt to not shuffle command-line arguments, so that their order is preserved     3. Add epydoc documentation for all python classes and functions
      1. Fix linking logic for _packPredicates (fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/401029)     2. Make gts-horse coarse original horse automatically
      Fix small bug in Velocity bins related to max sweep length (should improve performance as well). Still some incorrect things WRT bboxes, it seems.
      1. Fix mathematical error with VelocityBins, verified by new script scripts/test/collider-sweep-simple.py to be correct     2. Add py/ directory to skipped dirs for linkdeps.py so that it works on current trunk
      1. BIG CHANGE: pkg/ no longer have SConscript files but are scanned at startup for plugins. See http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ImplicitBuilds for some details. Let me know if there are some problems.
      add boost-serialization and boost-program-options to debian.
      1. Move STILimport to pkg/dem, as it depends on dem     2. update RockPM with the new-old version (probably svn didn't update the moved version? what a deal. We should definitely move to bzr...)
      1. Fix unreported version for the debian build
      1. Fix snow compilation by #including Voxel/* files in SnowVoxeslLoader and noc compiling them directly (sorry)     2. STLReader is a pure-header import lib now, tolerance is passed as regular data member.     3. Fix all warnings in ConcretePM.     4. Merge lib/yade-* into lib/yade-support.
      1. Fix monolithic compilation even with fem. All modules can now be compiled that way.
      fix compilation?
      Fix TetraTestGen crasher (functionally still brokne, though)
      Remove SDECLinkGeometry, replaced by SpheresContactGeometry at a few places. Not checked for functionality. This avoid many warnings.
      1. Fix linking with full Wm3 library     2. Automatically add /usr/include/wm3 to CPPPATH if useMiniWm3=False
      1. Hopefully fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/402098     2. Fast in TriaxialTest uses nBins==5 and binCoeff==2 for VelocityBins
      1. Fix SnapshotEngine and simple-scene-video.py to run. It doesn't work, though, because of the makeCurrent() failed error (probably getting snapshot from another thread...)
      1. Add GLViewer::nextFrameSnapshotFilename to save frame in postDraw     2. Adjust SnapshotEngine to take advantage of that. This should solve https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/396023     3. utils.encodeVideoFromFrames can take list of files (instead of just wildcard). Backwards-compatible.     4. scons doc skips debian/ directory (would mess up if deb package was build)
      1. Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/406343 (at least for me)
      1. Add GenericSpheresContactClass to unit radius1, radius2 and normal between SpheresContactGeometry and Dem3DofGeom (to make it work with GlobalSitffnessTimeStepper). Partially solves https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/399963
      1. Add docstrings to all wrapper.Omega() methods     2. Fix a few warnings.
      Fix has_map warning and one more in FlowEngine.
      1. Add infrastructure for getting temporary filenames in a secure manner to Omega     2. move selectedBOyd to MetaBody; initialize it properly to avoid possible crash.
      Remove leftover SConscripts.
      1. Change syntax of YADE_PLUGIN("Plugin1","Plugin2") to YADE_PLUGIN((Plugin1)(Plugin2)) (replaced everywhere)     2. Add some perliminary and not-enabled by default support for boost::serialization (see ClassFactory.hpp)     3. Add boost::serialization code for Se3r, Vector2r, Vector2<int>, Quaternionr     4. Do not reset BexContainer's moves and rotations uselessly (i.e. if not used)     5. Use Omega's mutex in SimulationController to prevent loading-related crashes
      1. Don't use __COUNTER__ to generate plugin registration function names, as they wre added in gcc 4.3 Use the name of the first plugin instead.     2. Dem3Dof_SphereSphere takes touching distance as equilibrium if distanceFactor is <=1. The initial position otherwise (was the default everytime until now)
      1. Generate proxy constructors to all classes deriving only from Serializable in python (like GLDrawBox and similar).     2. Fix scripts to have the new syntax everywhere, since e.g. EngineUnit is just abstract class that cannot be instantiated from python.     3. Add check fro valid data before saving plot to gnuplot; raise comprehensible exception if there is nothing to save.     4. Remove leftover scripts/pch.py
      1. Add an example of uniaxial tension-compression test for concrete (ready long time ago...)
      1. All different yade types are real python types now. They have their properties defined at startup. One can say O.bodies[0].shape.diffuseColor instead of O.bodies[0].shape['diffuseColor'] now. It also works much better with ipython tab-completion. It is not sure whether we will be able ever to deprecate the old object['attribute'] syntax.     2. Wrap ParallelEngine in python, and finish Dispatcher wraps as well.
      1. Reset interaction radius after the initial contacts have been created.
      Fix FileGenerator wrapper in PythonUI_rc.py (has different name in c++ (FileGenerator) and python (Preprocessor).
      1. Rename Preprocessor in python to FileGenerator, to be consistent with c++. Preprocessor is never used directly, anyway. The old deprecated name put in the deprecation table.     2. Manage crash at exit in defaut-test gracefully     3. Fix serialization of pairs (overlooked replace)
      1. Initial attempt at regression tests (only the python wrapper so far); run scripts/regression-tests.py     2. Fix a few bugs discovered that way :-)
      1. Replace PersistentSAPCollider and DistantPersistentSAPCollider by InsertionSortCollider everywhere. The two are still in the sources, but are not compiled. Will be removed in near future. Added to deprecated table in python so that old scripts still work.     2. Add some more regression tests for the python wrapper.     3. Fix timestep in HangingCloth (it does some weird things, can someone check it or just remove mass-spring from the tree?)
      1. Be more tolerant to specifying invalid GUI at the command line     2. Throw exception about unopenable $DISPLAY rather than letting QApplication abort()
      1. Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/409254
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/409254 take 2
      Maybe fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/409365
      1. Fix (?) https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/409254 by moving ClumpTestGen out of Clump.hpp     2. Avoid warnings in STL import code (return values _should_ be checked, though!)     3. Avoid warning in yade.cpp in optimized build
      1. Infrastructure for periodic collision handling. Not at all functional at this moment, don't even try to use.
      1. Beta version of periodic boundary conditions (try scripts/test/periodic-simple.py
      1. Assign new function O.exitNoBacktrace to sys.exit. Fixes partially https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/410250     2. Add some more comments to periodic stuff.
      1. Script that shrinks the periodic cell progressively (reveals bugs in the collider, though ;-) )     2. Add function to compute total force in volume from interactions to Shop, wrapped in _utils as well.
      1. Working periodic collider, yay!! scripts/test/periodic-grow.py shows that     2. A few changes related to that.
      1. Add PeriIsoCompressor for periodic isotropic compression; see scripts/test/periodic-compress.py. Not so much slower than regular triax, nice surprise.     2. Make SpherePack standalone class (previously just in python's _packSpheres), add the function to generate cloud of spheres, both periodic and non-periodic. _packSpheres wrapper is update, but otherwise not changed.     3. Fix python-less compilation for se3 interpolator engine     4. Add Omega().runEngine()     5. Fix some compilation/linking issues.
      1. Fix missing vtable for GenericSphereContact (crasher with debugging)     2. Fix collider stride for TriaxialTest with unspecified radius
      1. Try to fix locking with boost-1.35, possibly fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/411572 (please confirm)     2. Add periodic repetition function to SpherePack
      1. Fix linkage for boost<=1.34 (hopefully)
      1. Fix a few things in SpherePack     2. Remove TriaxialTest::GenerateCloud, replaced by SpherePack::makeCloud     3. Fix crash in BoundingVolumeMetaEngine, if MetaBody has no boundingVolume     4. Improve sorting operator, remove workarounds for std::sort wrapping minima/maxima (https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/402098)     5. Limit minimum cell width in PeriIsoCompressor, to not crash.     6. Add code for periodic packs in pack.triaxialPack (not yet fully functional)
      1. Add #pragma once to SpherePack.hpp (possibly cause of https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/412442)     2. Fix crash in TetraTestGen (finally, I think), closing https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/408422     3. Add highlight parameter to utils.{facet,sphere,box}, passed to Body::geometricalModel
      1. Fix assertion is 2d dispatch code, add indices to RpmPhys, RpmMat, CpmPhys, CpmMat (would break dispatching if using more classes derived from the same base in the dispatch matrix)
      1. Remove {,Distant}PersistentSAPCollider and Fixed{Position,Orientation}Engine classes     2. Add test script for generating packing
      1. Summarize important changes since the last release. Add your own things, if they are important for everybody (svn log has the small details)
      1. Add scripts/rename-class.py for renaming classes (replaces in code, moves files with bzr, adds rename record to python). Not very well tested, though.     2. Remove core/StandAloneSimulator.*pp (not used anymore)
      Add ignore patterns so that bzr st doesn't show (some) generated files
      1. Merged upstream changes.
      1. Clen the plugin loading logic a little (no nominal win32 support), support YADE_PREFIX for changing prefix (should be runtime-detected inthe future, anyway)     2. Use $ORIGIN in rpath to make yade relocatable; it can be fragile, let me know if there are troubles!     3. Add make check to the debian package (will be tested soon)
      1. Add compatibility for hardy     2. Fix missing newlines (hardy compiler gives warning)
      Adjust rpath for the main executable (ugly hack)
      Run tests in debian package (not failing if the test crashes, though, for now)
      1. IMPORTANT! All features are lower-cased now (avoids mess: openGL or OpenGL etc). This will probably break your profile files.     2. IMPORTANT! openmp is one of features, no longer a separate options. Adjust your profiles     3. Rename LOG4CXX to YADE_LOG4CXX; all features now #define YADE_FEATURE macros     4. Better $ORIGIN syntax in scons     5. Abort yade if running PythonUI_rc.py fails     6. Adjust pbuilder script
      1. Add wrapper for running tests, to trap exit segfault at squeeze     2. Use the wrapper for tests in debian/control     3. Add wrapper for vector<Se3r>
      Make the test script report what distribution failed (currently only karmic).
      Fix GTS features (thanks for spotting that; we need regression tests for all the modules)
      1. Skip more stuff in doxygen, a few warnings     2. Add debugging code to DynLibDispatcher (disabled)
      1. Rewrite 2d dispatching code from scratch     2. Expose classIndex to python for indexable classes     3. scripts/test-sphere-facet.py shows how the dispatch matrix fills with data
      Add python 2.5 compatibility hack
      Avoid error in pack.triaxialTest if compiled without GTS.
      1. PeriIsoCompressor: add keepProportions parameter (on by default), decrease global updates interval.     2. Omega: startSimulationLoop warns if there is no simulationLoop (how can that happen? It somehow can)     3. SpherePack: resets periodicity (and warns) if being rotated; cellSize is writable now.     4. pack.triaxialPack: renamed to pack.randomDensePack; fix loads of stuff in that; rename radiusStDev parameter to rRelFuzz; add epydoc documentation; fix erroneous detection of inGtsSurface being defined     5. wrapper: lock renderer when adding list of bodies; Omega().resetThisWorld to reset current world only.     6. Fix scripts/test/{gts-random-pack.py,gts-random-obb.py}
      ef2_Sphere_Sphere_Dem3Dof: change meaning of distanceFactor, see docs (if < 0, equilibrium is sum of radii, otherwise the initial distance; defaults to -1). Renamed to distFactor, to break old code intentionally     InteractingSphere2AABB: allow negative aabbEnlargeFactor, which doesn't scale aabb at all (same as if it is 1.)     yade-multi: use the first non-blank line as column headings (not necessarily the first line of the file, as is used to be)     SpatialQuickSortCollider: fix clearing interaction with openMP     examples/concrete/uniaxial: move files around, add confinement and docs; remove examples/concrete/pack since not in the pack module (an example should be given, though)     examples/collider-perf: remove PersistentSAPCollider, add InsertionSortCollide with strides, but commented out since no effect at hthe beginning of simulation     PeriodicInsertionSortCollider: remove unnecessary (hopefully) condition that would abort in scripts/test/periodic-simple.py
      PeriIsoCompressor: fix absolute displacements changing proportions, operate on averages instead     pack.randomDensePack: fix proportions in periodic packs; change residual stress to 1e8 instead of 1e9
      SConstruct: remove obsolete (unused) standalone openmp option
      yadeWrapper: Fix compilation with boost<1.35 (again)
      (now?)
      1. Fix startup crash if no $DISPLAY set at all
      miniWm3Wrap: update with newer py++; still errors out at karmic     spirit: avoid warning with newer boost versions
      Add gts to depends on the script.
      Remove unnecessary inclusion of indexing_suite which breaks compilation for boost<1.34 (or something like that).
      utils.uniaxialTestFeatures: fix compat with py2.5     SConstruct: fix compilation issues with older symlinks in include dirs
      Fix OperationalError, reported by Janek in https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/416906
      SConstruct: add doc for pretty, fix a few lib checks on karmic
      Fix version detection on systems where version is not specified by hand or in RELEASE file and bzr is not installed
      main: disable SIGHUP handler (emergency save) and automatic loading.
      1. Remove garbage from examples.     2. Fix SpheresFactory, fix examples/SpheresFactory/model.py
      move SpheresFactor to scripts/test as it doesn't work. Add notes to changelog and news.
      Forgotten file
      Mark release version
      Add mill script mimicking http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=005rdDBoe4w     Some changes in qt interface (useless)     Add series to package version to allow same version for multiple series in the ppa (0.20-1~hardy, 0.20-1~karmic etc)
      Added script for http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUv26xlh89I
      1. Fix facet lighting, mill shown with wire=False now (looks better)     2. Revert recent useless change in QtGUI-python
      1. Enabling O.timingEnabled when running will not produce garbage values for current engine anymore     2. Add maxRefRelStep to VelocityBins, to limit speed fo maximum velocity changes     3. Fix epydoc format for utils.encodeVideoFromFrames and utils.uniaxialTestFeatures
      1. Do not save potential-only interactions to the XML; do not save pendingErase interactions (are only potential)     2. Do not save interactions in SQLiteRecorder by default (saveInteractions=True if you want the old behavior)     3. Add slider to the simulation player, in the "snaps" tab
      1. Add scene that has been sitting here for a few days (should be run for comparison with pfc3d)
      Workaround bug #416335; static members of Vector3 work only on instance, e.g. Vector3.ZERO will not work, you have to use Vector3().ZERO; changed all occurences in the code accordingly, update your scripts as well.\n2.Some undocumented and untested enhancements for parameter table (backwards compatible)

      1. RockPM update. Added simple "destruction mechanism"     2. Added scripts/installOnUbuntu.sh to make "oneButton-checkout+compile+install+doxygen+epydoc" script. Not tested yet. Requires corrections.
      1. Updated some scripts according to new syntax
      1. Added PressTestEngine for simulating presses.        Can be used and for PointLoadTest simulations.
      1. Updated simple-scene-graph.py according to a new syntax     2. Updated simple-scene-video.py according to a new syntax
      1. Changes on PressTestEngine. Now it defines the destruction moment more precisely     2. YADE CONSOLE emblem shows now without upper row shifted.
      1. Some small changes
      1. All variables initialize in PressTestEngine and RockPm
      Some changes on News
      Fix compile error
      1. Partly fixed
      1. Almost fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/412892     Just 1 warning:
      Some changes in INSTALL file because of migrating to BZR
      Some changes on one-click-install script
      Added "warning" in one-click-install script
      1. Fixes compiling error without openmp feature.

      Press Engine and RockPM changes
      Added demonstration of buldozer simulation
      "Thanks" and Thanks to Janek :)
      Fixes VTK-librabry dependencies for Ubuntu
      Some small changes on Buldozer

Bruno Chareyre (16):
      1. Fixed a critical bug in ElasticContactInteraction (kn, was not registered and left undefined after loading a simulation).     2. Test if fn!=0 (i.e. contact exists) before adding kn/ks to the global stiffness.
      1. "Water" classes are updated based on the code developped locally (but not commited for a while) by Luc Scholtes.     2. Triangulation code updated as well (not compiled by default).
      1. Add a missing class (for the capillarity model), this fixes a compilation error in the previous commit due to the missing files.
      The "stopSimulation" command in the compression engine is now optional, as sometimes you don't want it to stop at all(1).     The default behaviour of the compressionEngine is not affected, with autoStopSimulation=true by default.     However, the TriaxialTest IS affected : it sets autoStopSimulation=false by default.
      1. Update capillary files and add a new engine for them.     2. Prepare for removing old useless classes (typically some variants of engines with "water" at the end)
      Remove useless dependency.
      -Avoid crash when computing fusion number (it was using pointers to deleted interractions)     FIXME : no distant meniscii for now due to deletion by the contact law.
      Base class for the solid-fluid coupling (E. Catalano PhD).
      -Register "thickness" so that sample dimensions are computed correctly (and not with 0 thickness)
      Dimensions could be 0 when "updateParameters" was called from TriaxialCompressionEngine before     TTController::action
      Missing  declarations in r1836.
      - cleanup : removing unused (and useless) "water" variants of engines     - some cleanup in recorders too
      Update of the read/write functions for the connection     with comsol. (coupling via Berkeley<->Grenoble mail servers! ;))
      Missing declarations of member variables.
      <none>
      Set default read/write behaviour as in Andrea's version.

Feng Chen (1):
      This is viscous force damping, equation similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping, damping parameters are controlled by betaNormal and betaShear, it is sometimes more realistic than the non-viscous (or say, local) damping.     While using this code, please make a reference to:

Janek Kozicki (40):
      created nearly empty snow package: pkg-snow
      Snow stuff - generate grains made of layers according to voxel data read from file. And daraw it.
      forgot some files
      - make it compile with boost 1.34     - some snow improvements
      - another fix. now it really compiles with boost 1.34
      1. TriaxialStressController reads radius from interactingGeometry
      Code wasn't compiling because of #include MicroMacroAnalyser - comment it out.
      1. argh, guys. svn HEAD must compile. You didn't check your commits and then I waste 1h to fix that. See this commit, to check what I had to comment out about WATER
      - added keyboard shortcut '.' that toggles grid subdivision by 10     - fixed error with grid step     - grid step is now shown in gl window
      small snow update
      another small snow update
      1. small snow update     2. fix compilation error by Vaclav (hey, you didn't compile again before commit! ;p )
      rename file to avoid case conflict with directory
      1. GLViewer - when sth. is selected don't move it to 0,0,0 position, but use its original position. This is done by delaying assignment to the next call of draw()
      - added extensive comments to the polyhedron code which will be used for collisions
      small snow update
      maybe spheres won't disappear anymore?
      a placeholder for drawing snow interactions
      changed guards to #pragma once
      postpone creating a 3d view, until a file is loaded. That should hopefully fix the problem with the primary view being empty.
      added AUTHORS file, for the purpose of updating file headers.     This was copied from  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Authors
      Why do I have the impression that I'm adding this file a second time? After all it's referred to in almost all source files "See file LICENSE for details.", right?
      sort people in alphabetical order
      sorry for bumping up revisions....
      Snow, as it is finished by me. Further work on it will to be done by next post-doc     researcher who wants money from EU for working on this :)
      fix miniwm3 / full wm3 compilation error
      I forgot to add those, sorry. (I wonder how it could stay unnoticed for so long ;)
      add option for horizontal or vertical wires in fibre reinforced concrete.
      1. correct display of lattice rods on 0th iteration     2. on/off switch for using different stiffness for tension and compression in lattice     3. fixed a bug in BodyRedirectionVector related to deleting of bodies     4. two more lattice examples     5. few more safety checks in lattice code
      1. NullGUI was still usin .gz while thay are not supported anymore     2. small lattice update
      sanitize stupid numers in QtGUI, eg. 0.1299999999999 becomes 0.13
      small fix
      after isNew and isReal are removed I'll update the code to use new contact logic.
      Add an option to display DOFs and body IDs in the OpenGL window
      - Lattice uses DOFs now     - old implementation is still accessible by setting a flag backward_compatible, so that hundreds of my old FileGenerator files will still work     - some improvements to recording strains and forces
      - fix all my warnings     - lattice generator improvements wrt concrete with steel fibres
      - some improvements wrt to generation of densely packed aggregates and steel fibres in the concrete structure
      - testing command "bzr commit --fixes lp:414868"     - fixing bug 414868
      Fix stupid error introduced when we have migrated to bex container
      1. get snow code to run, albeit still buggy     2. why dynamic_casts stopped working everywhere, that's a mystery to me     3. interactions isNew doesn't exist anymore, snow code needs update for this

Jerome Duriez (2):
      - Correction of the headers of two files "ContactLaw1Interaction" which were commited by me and not by Bruno     - Some features of ContactLaw1Interaction were declared in ElasticContactInteraction. This was a mistake totally not planned (and the fact it was in svn also was not     noticed) and is now corrected
      - End of the job by suppressing also the corresponding lines in .cpp...

Luc Sibille (1):
      I added a new engine "ThreeDTriaxialEngine" to perform triaxial simulations with an independant control in stress or in strain in     the three space directions respectively. In this goal, the TriaxialStressControlEngine has been sligtly modified to impose a     different stress value or strainrate in each space direction. I hope I have broken nothing!

Sergei Dorofeenko (28):
      Intermediate commit for SpheresFactory. Don't work yet.     1. New engine SpheresFactory     2. Add function engineByLabel to MetaBody     3. Add members to BroadInteractor.
      1.First worked version of SpheresFactory engine. Example in examples/SpheresFactory     2.Added PersistentSAPCollider::probeBoundingVolume function (for using with SpheresFactory)     3.InteractionGeometryMetaEngine::explicitAction has been modified to remove artifical (as me seems) asserts.     4.python import_stl_geometry now return list of body ids instead only their number.     5.import stl geometry now allows import facets without BoundingVolume  and InteractingGeometry.     6.Fixed dynamic_cast for BroadInteractor.
      1. SpheresFactory allows now to create spheres in a convex volume.     2. SimulationController estimates total simulation time if stopAtIteration>0.
      1. SimulationPlayer now allows to reload filters without reloading all simulation.     2. ColorizedVelocityFilter now allows to setup minValue,maxValue without reloading the filter.
      Fixed bug in RotationEngine: rotationAxis now normalized in action(), not in postProcessAttributes()
      ColorizedVelocityFilter counts a scale for each frame, without using previous min,max values.
      Class SimpleViscoelasticInteraction is renamed to ViscoelasticInteraction and is inherited from ElasticContactInteraction now.
      1. Convert SimpleViscoelasticContactLaw to ConstitutiveLaw engine unit (Spheres_Viscoelastic_SimpleViscoelasticContactLaw).     2. SimulatonPlayer have now Display tab as one in SimulationController.
      1. The experimental widget for drawing a color scale for colorized velocity filter.     2. Convenient python function utils.ColorizedVelocityFilter.
      Merging utils.*_v2 functions with their "first" analogs.
      Add two new filters: ColorizedTimeFilter and PythonRunnerFilter
      Migrate GravityEngines and ConstitutiveLaw to BEX_CONTAINER
      Convert STLImporterTest to ConstitutiveLaw (SimpleViscoelastic contact model) and NewtonsDampedLaw engine.
      Fix bug in serialization for ViscoelasticInteraction.     Fix compilation error for InteractionHashMap
      Update contact logic for SpatialQuickSortCollider (hope, it's correct)
      Fix typo in PersistentSAPCollider
      1. Remove zeroPoint     2. Add prefix ef2_ to Spheres_Viscoelastic_SimpleViscoelasticContactLaw
      Fix link errors
      fixed and updated some examples in keeping with last modifications
      Realise InsertionSortCollider::probeBoundingVolume() so SpheresFactory now works
      SpheresFactory now can create a spheres by python function. See scripts/test/SpheresFactory/model.py for example.
      Add export python module with VTKWriter class (very initial) to export data from YADE to VTK-based post-processing tools
      Added a c++ VTKRecorder (for spheres and facets) and new feature 'vtk' needed for it.
      Add colors rec to VTKRecorder
      Add default path for VTK
      Fix VTKRecorder headers
      Fix VTKRecorder headers
      Add VTKINCDIR to configure options for directories where to look for VTK headers

Unknown (1):
      The isotropic compaction into the TraxialTest is activated: 1)I have deleted the translationspeed parameter (now the translation speed of walls is the strainRate parameter) 2)I have activated the porosity parameter in the TriaxailStressController.cpp file

Vincent Richefeu (38):
      - add the soft mgpost for DEM simulation post-processing and visualization.
      - set menus in english mode
      A very quick guide for mgpost (usage and XML format)
      a forgotten file in mgpost/doc
      - add a new tool for sphere packing (still in dev)     - some enhancement in mgpost interface
      - SpherePadder devel...
      SpherePadder devel...
      SpherePadder (devel: 5 steps ok)
      - SpherePadder update     - add a basic 'user friend' interface for sphere packing generation. The module can of course be used without this interface.
      Speed enhacement for the SpherePadder algorithm.
      Add possibility to make PNG screenshots (using libpng)
      Add a DataRecoder that generate MGP files (only for Spheres for the moment).     The MGP files can then be read with mgpost.
      - add a class based on CGAL for 3D triangulation.     - Packing method enhanced (place 380000 spheres in less than 2 min)
      Fix some bugs and enhance the display of positive and negative forces
      Fix some bugs
      Begin devel. of densification process
      2 files that were forgotten
      Simplify sphere shapes when if there number is increased
      Bug corrections (min and max radii)
      - overlap with spheres inserted by user -> bug fixed     - Densification begins to work
      Increase the number of colors for the display of body's groupMasks from 6 to 10
      We can now make the packing denser with a stop criterion based on the solid fraction or total number of spheres.
      Add BasicViscoelasticRelationships: an alternative to SimpleViscoelasticRelationships. It accounts for the effective mass of each contact and considere the parameter cn as a dimensionless ponderation of its critical value (computed for each contact). Parameter cs is set to zero for the moment.
      Add a boost.python wrapper (module packing)
      Add a function to SpherePadder_wrapper to pass the result back to python.     As Vaclav suggested, it is a list of (x,y,z,R) tuples.     (Complet integration into yade is not done yet)
      - Add 'HistoryRecorder' to save the sample and network state with a given time-step interval.     - Correct a small bug due to the fact that a Clump cannot be casted into a GeometricalModel (and I don't know why!)
      Use the clump mass instead of clump-member mass for the determination of the effective mass.
      Ooops! There was a bug
      Add the function NormalRestitution2DampingRate.
      Add sphere reading for gdm-tk format
      Remove default linkage with libtiff (png is now prefered)
      Add an example of python script for SpherePadder
      Add GroupRelationData serialization (not used yet in *Relationships classes)     This class serves to manage parameters between bodies depending on their groupMasks.     Here is an example of 'command stream' in xml file to set the parameters:     <grpRelationData _className_="GroupRelationData"  commands_="[ngrp 2 parameter kn setall kn 1e6]" />
      Just try to use GroupRelationData with BasicViscolelasticRelationships.
      Cast size_t to int in pow(double,int) function to avoid ambiguity for gcc (compilation failled on one of my computer)
      Some tiny modifications for Mac OS X compatibility (Does not compil yet).
      Some forgotten tasks
      replace gcc-3.3 by gcc in the Makefile.macosx of mgpost

Václav Šmilauer (269):
      1. Add linear templated interpolation function working on 2 lists, t and values     2. Add InterpolatingRotationEngine that changes rotation speed as given by value table     3. Lower info about starting python thread to debug message only.
      1. Rename REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE(class,bool) to REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE_GENERIC, add two macros REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE and REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE_FUNDAMENTAL. Changed all uses accordingly.     2. Added REGISTER_CLASS_AND_BASE(class,base) which performs REGISTER_CLASS_NAME and REGISTER_BASE_CLASS_NAME at once.     3. Added REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES (not trailing 'S'), expanding to void registerAttributes(){...}, and REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES_WITH_BASE, which prepends call to baseClass::registerAttributes() (specified as the first argument).
      1. Added Se3Interpolator engine, with scripts/test/Se3Interpolator.py     2. Added from math import * to PythonUI_rc.py so that math functions are readily accessible everywhere     3. Implemented stopStrain in UniaxialStrainControlledTest     4. other small fixes
      1. Modify REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES macro so that it work with or without base class given. Change all headers in core to use that. It should help us if we ever make the transition to boost::serialization.     2. User REGISTER_CLASS_AND_BASE instead of REGISTER_CLASS_NAME and REGISTER_BASE_CLASS in core and at a few other places.
      1. Removed cerr garbage from glviewer (use LOG_DEBUG if needed)
      1. Fix warnings in GLViewer     2. Add (35.4%)-style counter if stopAtIteration is set to the OSD in gl view     3. Add utils.downCast to downcast object to its derived class and copying all attributes.     4. Add utils.SpherePWaveTimeStep to compute critical dt from a few parameters only     5. Add routine to compute overall kinetic energy to Shop (indirectly to utils as well)     6. Add routine to sum torque (momentum) with respect to an axis from forces and torques on given set of bodies.
      Fix typo (compilation error in debug mode) in Shop::kineticEnergy
      1. Fix a bug in rotation ode in SpheresContactGeometry. Now the code gives the same results as almost-for-sure-correct FEM code regarding strain computation.     2. Add label attribute to StandAloneEngine (inherits from Engine)
      omg
      (code cleanup, no functional changes)
      Exit once the simulation finishes; do not rely on simulation exiting itself.
      1. SpiralEngine that does both rotation and translation along the same axis     2. InterpolatingSpiralEngine for variable rotation+translation speed (replaces InterpolationgRotationEngine)     3. scripts/test-spiral.py for rudimentary functionality testing.
      1. Un-disallow (bug) having all dimensions scalable in triaxial if particle radius is fixed.     2. Don't record anything by default to file in UniaxialStrainer (only useful for debugging)
      1. Add a few functions for integrating piecewise-linear functions in new module yade.linterpolation
      1. fix damage colorizer (removed dynamic_cast causing segfaults on non-spheres)     2. InterpolatingSpiralEngine now takes bool wrap rather than Real period.     3. qt.makePlayerVideo takse startWait argument, which waits for Backspace before starting (useful for setting up the view manually); postLoadHook gets run afterwards now.
      1. Add algorithm for pushing sphere always to the same side when in contact with facet, even under extreme stress where the sphere geometrically passes to the other side.     2. Add bool SpheresContactGeometry::initContactOnPositiveFacetSide for that     3. Add test/demo script for that.     4. Re-enabled GLDrawSphere::glutUse (cosurgi?)     5. Renamed yade.runtime.args to argv, to be consistent with sys.argv     6. Allow passing sys.argv (arguments to scripts) through QtGUI as well
      1. Fix clip plane orientation inversion as well as wheel normal movement.     2. Clip planes not displayed at all unless one of the clip planes is being manupulated.
      1. Unbreak bad type (list) for sys.argv[0], broken recently     2. Color bodies by residual strength rather than damage parameter (smoother)     3. Make player messages (maybe) better formatted
      omg...
      1. Make player reuse existing renderer if there is one (allows setting Draw_mask etc before running player)     2. Add initRun parameter to PeriodicEngine (false by default), to run at the very fist run.
      1. Make BrefcomDamageColorizer run at 0th iteration as well     2. Make player set stopAtIter to last iteration in db so that percentage is displayed in the output.
      Fix previous commit, overlooked. sorry.
      1. Number lines in parameter table for multijobs from 1 (as text editors do)     2. Print short summary at the end of job log (when started, when finished, exit status, duration, commandline)
      1. Fix logic typo in QtGUI (warning when there shouldn't be and vice versa)
      1. logarithmic strain for Brefcom.     2. change sphere-facet algorithm such that it works on corners. Maybe no longer necessary, but it doesn't hurt now. scripts/test-sphere-facet-corner.py as provided by sega demonstrates that.     3. "from __future__ import division" in python init such that 3/2==1.5 and 3//2=1 (is default since python 2.6)     4. Global GL lock to avoid crashes/freezes with GL accessed from multiple threads concurrently. scripts/gl-test.py (which used to crash) now works with one view;     5. Properly lock/unlock on all gl ops in QtGUI-python.cpp, like setting view direction, resizing etc.     6. Fix wrong assertion in SQLite player     7. add Omega().resetTime to reset iteration number, virtual and real time.     8. Changed utils.loadVars/saveVars code to be more reliable.     9. Added utils.aabbExtrema2d
      1. Lock GL when closing view. Seems to fix crashes / delays at exit
      1. Contact sphere-facet must be deleted by the constitutive law once created. Let me know if that is a problem -- I think it is the way it should be in the future everywhere, though.     2. Fixes for boost 1.37 (boost::thread not fully compatible)     3. utils.basidDEMEngines (not tested yet)     4. Fix warning in GroupRelationData     5. add march switch to scons ('native' is default, but not supported by older compilers)     6. Prepend default CXXFLAGS so that user-defined ones (like warning suppression) come after the default ones and override those.
      1. Tentative fix for newer scons, which links empty files (dummy plugins) with plain gcc and doesn't find default c++ libs to link with.
      1. File not needed.
      1. Beautify no-debug code in main     2. SpiralEngine now saves angle it has turned so far     3. Remove failing assertion from IFacet2ISphere4SCG (why it fails? it was a (I->isReal&&I->interactionGeometry)||(!I->isReal&&!I->interactionGeometry)...)     4. Improve the utils.spiralproject function to specify period (moderately tested, but seems to work)     5. Adjust locks in GLViewer. Fixes my crashes on nvidia for both player and 3d view (didn't dare to try 2nd view). Next step will be to move this lock to Omega and lock it when loading/resetting simulation etc.     6. Change theora video quality to 63 (maximum) instead of medium 32 in utils.encodeVideoFromFrames. Makes the video about 3x bigger.
      Two BIG changes:
      1. Add ef2_Spheres_Brefcom_BrefcomLaw, is faster (!)     2. Fix locking in Omega, we don't get crashes when loading simulation with the 3D view enabled anymore (please report any further crashes in OpenGLRenderingEngine, that should be fixed)     3. Automatic update of Doxygen configuration file     4. Dem3DofContactGeometry, which should be in near future parent of SpheresContactGeometry and other new geometries providing normal and shear strains (SphereFacetContactGeometry, in my mind)     5. Add convenience function to apply force to contact point between two particles.
      (remove no-warn for c++0x since that flag is not known to gcc-3.4)
      1. Add possibility to change container types from python (for benchmarks) -- code not yet tested!     2. Possible optimization in PhysicalActionVectorVector, now disabled.
      collider mistake hotfix
      1. Make triaxial stop if !autoCompressionActivation and already unloaded. If this breaks something, please let me know, we can do it otherwise, but, for Cundall's sake, can we keep the same behavior for at least 6 months??     2. SpatialQuickSortCollider will not delete real contacts, even if bodies don't collide.     3. Remove redundant attribute registration from SpheresContactGeometry
      fix typo in collider
      1. removed persistentInteraction from most places; they are still present in MetaBody, but not serialized any more, most importantly (avoids warnings) and not GL-drawn.     2. Plugin loading loginc completely changes, the underlying macro YADE_PLUGIN has still the same interface. We used __attribute__((constructor)), __attribute__((visibility("internal"))) and anonymous namespace magic to get there. This will make it possible to put multiple plugins to a single shared library without touching the source, only fiddling with SConscript's.     3. PythonUI is interactive by default (it was not?? weird.)
      1. Add new non-generic Bex container. For non-optimized build, it increased the speed by about 11% (9:35 vs. 8:49) as compared to PhysicalActionVectorVector.
      Users willling to go with the slower PhysicalActionContainer can compile with scons CXXFLAGS=-DNO_BEX now to get the old behavior.
      1. Adapted TriaxialTest and ElasticContactLaw to BexContainer (switchable at compile-time).     2. Adapter GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper to BexContainer (GlobalStiffnessCounter code put to a function inside this one, hence that engine is not needed anymore).     3. Adapted Shop::Bex to BexContainer (probably not needed anymore?)     4. Exception is thrown in PhysicalActionVectorVector is used && built with BEX_CONTAINER (would most likely crash anyway).     5. transientInteractions and persistentInteractions are only references to MetaBody::interactions now. Removed extra loops in InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine and InteractionGeometryMetaEngine.     6. Remove including qglviewer into miniWm3, as it breaks compilation if using miniWm3 separately from yade (for testing purposes).
      1. Define Janek's functions to convert from/to QGLViewer vector where they are used.
      1. Add BexContainer (same interface, but separate implementation) in openMP flavor.     2. openmp=0 is the default for scons now (for some time), since openMP BexContainer gives about 7% slowdown and thus is not useful before at least some engines are parallelized as well.     3. Removed getting references to Force/Torque from BexContainer, since that breaks concurrency. Instead, addForce/addTorque must be used. If you need to read back with getForce/getTorque, you have to call sync() (expensive!!) beforehand, which will compute summary values for all bodies; if you forget, exception will be thrown. Note that sync() is invalidated at next write operation.     4. Adapted a few constitutive laws and other engines for the changes mentiones here.
      1. Add time-profiling classes. See http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Speed_profiling_using_TimingInfo_and_TimingDeltas_classes for details. It is accessible from python as well.     2. SimulationController no longer asks for output format. It just uses XML, the only available one.     3. Engine, EngineUnit have timingInfo member and pointer to optional timingDeltas. Timing is disabled by default, but it may still have some overhead in the order <1% perhaps (will test)
      1. Forgotten file with yade.timing.stats() that pretty-prints some numbers.
      1. Move all container to core, remove linking with them since it is not necessary     2. Fix things so that everything compiles (at least) both with and without BexContainer     3. Parallelize ConstitutiveLawDispatcher, InteracionPhysicsMetaEngine and InteractionGeometryMetaEngine with openMP if enabled on command-line     4. Make InteractionVecMap default container for interactions; necessary for parallel code.
      1. New InteractionDispatchers class that has one common loop for InteractionGeometryMetaEngine, InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine and ConstitutiveLawDispatcher. It can be used from python like this:
      1. Adapt ForceEngine to BexContainer     2. Add BEX_CONTAINER and YADE_OPENMP flags to be reported by -h.
      1. Add two more forgotten headers. They are not used anywhere, though, and will be removed later.
      1. Enhancement of utils.box from Marco.
      1. Make Shop load 4/5/6 columns text files for spheres (and skip 5-cols)     2. Change evaluation of args in readParamsFromTable to be able to pass strings better (single quotes) and consistently     3. Parameters passed as env. vars by yade-multi are prefixed with !     4. fix typo in timing for resetting timers.
      1. Make the yade-multi scheduler multithread-aware.     2. Add the collider performance test as example     3. added utils.replaceCollider(anotherCollider) for convenience     4. added Omega().isChildClassOf(classNameChild,classNameParent)
      1. Fix collider-perf (TriaxialTest has hardcoded dt=0.001 !!!!), set timestep by hand at first     2. Fix Shop:: loading spheres from file (regression from yesterday)     3. Add functorCache to Interaction and to InteractionDispatchers. About 5% improvement, but not yet finished.     4. Add DynLibDispatcher::getFunctor2D     5. Add BexContainer::sync() to other places in triaxial (thrown otherwise)
      1. Fix old rename of runtime.args to runtime.argv in default-test.py. Should run OK now.
      1. Fix for the compile error in snow for OrthogonalPlaneFit3. It still misses pkg/snow/Engine/ElawSnowLayersDeformation.cpp in the repo. Compile with exclude=...,snow as workaround.
      1. Rename BroadInteractor to Collider.     2. Move some part of the contact logic to this common base class. The Collider::handleExistingInteraction is subject to discussion and not yet used.
      1. Small fix in the collider code.
      1. Remove SAPCollider completely     2. Make yade log4cxx 0.10 compatibile     3. Other minor fixes
      1. Fix linking of realtime-rigidbody WRT PersistentSAPCollider
      1. change default xiShear to 0 instead of NaN (is not used anyway)     2. Fix linking of mass-spring in cliean build
      1. Fix #include's that include files not in the current source directory via "".     2. Add scripts/linkdeps.py that can automatically determine what plugin links to what other plugins, which can be once used for configurable monolithic/pluggable builds etc.
      1. Fix crashed in TriaxialTest introduced by me a few days ago (referencing engine before being created)     2. Add simple (working?) memory usage query to utils and collider perf test.
      1. Fixed collider performance benchmark     2. Added script to generate graph from log files (like http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace)
      1. Added SpheresContactGeometry::updateShearForce, will be used (not activated though yet) by ElasticContactLaw and other.
      hotfix related to last commit
      1. Initial checkout for the DemXDofGeom classes (will contain the hasShear code from SpheresContactGeometry and more eventually).
      1. Preliminary version for sphere-facet collisions with total formulation (moderately tested).     2. Same for sphere-sphere collision.     3. test script for facet-sphere collision geometry.
      1. Use local foreach.hpp if not found in the system     2. Use local file defining boost::python::len for boost<1.34
      1. remove explicit linkage to boost_python in gui/SConscript
      Forgotten empty file.
      1. Remove logger from ClassFactory     2. Cleanup logging stuff in main (use constructor function, among other)     3. Cleanup system exit from python in PythonUI_rc.py     4. Add SpheresContactGeometry::updateShear that can be optionally used with ElasticContactLaw to update shear displacement instead of updating shearForce. triax-identical-results.py show quite large difference between both implementations, but I am not able to tell which one is correct. scripts/test/shear.py shown almost no difference for 2-sphere scenarios, modulo differences at 15th decimal place or so.     5. Remove debug output from BexContainer     6. Remove warning about meniscus data from CapillaryCohesiveLaw (warning is given in postProcessAttributes now, i.e. iff the class is actually used)     7. Add logger to snow.     8. Removed shear computation code in ElasticContactLaw, use SpheresContactGeometry::updateShearForce.     9. Fix scons deprecation warnings
      1. Add functions to augment forces/torques in BexContainer.
      1. Remove some garbage from SpheresContactGeometry     2. Verify that SCG_SHEAR doesn't alter behavior if ElasticContactLaw::useShear is false     3. Implement SCG_SHEAR for sphere-box interactions     4. sphere-box interactions no longer call goReverse, but swap interaction order instead, as facets do.     5. Fix triax-idnetical-results.py to reload generated initial config to avoid rounding issues of sphere coords in text file.
      Minifix: link core with librt (clock_gettime) for platforms that require it
      1. Add rate-dependent damage to normal and viscoplasticity to shear components of Brefcom (not yet tested, just compiles); other cleanups there.
      1. add addF and addT to legacy ActionContainer
      Add label attribute to engine units. Python wrapper updated.
      1. Rate-dependent fixes (more to come) in brefcom.
      1. Remove MetaBody::physicalActions if compiling with BEX_CONTAINER (default)     2. Make everything work with both BexContainer and deprecated PhysicalActionContainer     3. Change PhysicalActionDamper, PhysicalActionDamperUnit, PhysicalActionApplier and PhysicalActionApplierUnit to dispatch only according to PhysicalParameters (not PhysicalAction anymore). That means that only one unit will be called for each body and that NewtonsMomentumLaw has to do the job of NewtonsForceLaw as well (same for CundallNonViscousMomentumDamping).     4. Fix (finally) defaultDt computation in TriaxialTest (forgotten assignment to defaultDt in the GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper)     5. Fix (finally?) timestep manipulation form within the QtGUI. If reloading the same file, timestep settings will be preserved, otherwise those saved in the XML are used.
      1. Create ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw that has the ElasticContactLaw algorithm     2. ElasticContactLaw now merely calls ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw.     3. TriaxialTest::parallel controls whether to use InteractionDispatchers or not.     4. Added examples/triax-perf to show the impact of that. Also see http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Triaxial_Test_Parallel     5. Fix a few compilation issues.     6. Flush stdout before exiting from main, so that in case of crash upon exit (log4cxx?) we have all messages output.
      1. Hotfix for 2 issues with ElasticContactLaw
      1. Remove all traces of physical actions:
      1. Remove Shop::Bex (no longer necessary)     2. Add InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine for Roger (not yet tested!)
      1. Fix linking of ForceEngine with interpolation     2. Random rate-dependent things.     3. Typo in BexContainer docs
      1. A few fixes in Brefcom.     2. Make python wrapper correctly handle long long attributes.     3. Added test script for InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine
      1. MAJOR change in python syntax (backwards-compatible, though): through small bit of very dirty code,  classes can be instantiated as python objects with keyowrd arguments, i.e. instead of
      1. cleanup UniaxialStrainer code, add vars to control length of the acceleration phase and the ability to set absolute speed     2. EngineUnits within InteractionDispatchers can be labeled and accessed from python now.     3. A few minor things in the plot module
      1. Remove cruft from brefcom, a few fixes there     2. Add gnuplot grid to gnuplot by default     3. Fix speed in USCT     4. Fix InteractionDispatchers traversal in pyOmega
      1. Fix weird python problem if LIBS is not defined by distuils (?)
      1. Add working version of facet adjacency finder (to get their mutual angle at edge)
      1. Parallelize initial bound filling in PersistentSAPCollider. Gives almost 3x speedup for the first step.     2. Fix missing headers so that it compiles with g++-4.4 (in QGLViewer)     3. FacetTopologyAnalyzer works (not tested extensively), questions of where to put topology data for InteractingFacet (will be raised on yade-dev)     4. Test script for FacetTopologyAnalyzer.
      1. Remove leftover var in PersistentSAPCollider
      1. Add preliminary gnuplot plots merging facility to yade-multi     2. Fix yade.log module so that it also works without log4cxx (and gives 1 warning)     3. Switch to new syntax in scripts/plot.py
      1. Fix race condition in brefcom (omp critical section)     2. Remove -ffast-math from optimized build, since NaNs do not work properly (e.g. isnan(NaN)==false!)
      1. Fix bug in FacetTopologyAnalyzer algorithm     2. Add angle info to InteractingFacet (not yet used)     3. Add triangulated sphere test for FacetTopoloyAnalyzer to facet-topo.py     4. Fixes in rate-dep in brefcom
      1. Add approximate viscosity equations to brefcom (not working)     2. Fixes in yade-multi
      1. Finish implementation of Dof3DofGeom_FacetSphere (with plastic slip as well)     2. Adapt Brefcom optionally to Dem3DofGeom     3. Add d0fixup to SpheresContactGeometry to get correct normal strain in sphere-facet contact with fictive sphere     (zero for sphere-sphere)     4. Finish FacetTopologyAnalyzer; angle usage in Dem4DofGeom_FacetSphere not yet tested.
      1. Remove cruft from UniaxialStrainer, add the ability to set initial velocities to suppress inertia at the simulation beginning     2. Jobs in yade-multi can be automatically named after variables suffixed with !     3. yade-multi now shows and updates automatically some statistic on localhost:9080 using http
      1. Finish Dem3Dof for both spheres and facets, migrate Brefcom. Removing stuff from SpheresContactGeometry is on schedule, once thorough testing is finished.     2. Fix attribute inheritance for a few engine units     3. Add ef2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_ElasticLaw, which works like ElasticContactLaw (but faster ;-) )     4. Remove BrefcomLaw, keep just the constitutive law as functor. Adapt sample generators for that.     5. Add hydrostatic confinement to brefcom (isoPrestress), remove viscApprox.     6. Add interface for querying and setting (doesn't work yet) number of openMP threads     7. Job description is taken from columns suffixed with ! or by combining all parameters     8. Add function for plotting yeild surface of brefcom to the eudoxos module     9. Oofem export now uses reference (starting) positions of particles as it should     10. Add "-" before profile name when generating default variant suffix in scons (which is expected)
      Fix comp9ilation error for Janek.
      1. Add python wrapper for clumps, see scripts/test/clump.py on how to use it (O.bodies.appendClumped)     2. Fix clump support in NewtonsDampedLaw (damping is quite wrong, it seems...; Bruno, any ideas on that?)     3. Move clump to pkg-dem (even though it depends on extra/Shop)     4. Remove absolute shear computation from SpheresContactGeometry, as Dem3Dof works fine now and Brefcom will not use SCG anymore; adapt a few other classes to that; remove ElasticContactLaw2 that was using it.     5.
      1. Warn in --version if -ffast-math was used
      1. Fixing bug in TriaxialCompressionEngine (introduced by luc apparently).
      Big changes:
      Handle boundingVolume-less bodies gracefully in InsertionSortCollider
      1. Add utils.regularSphereOrthoPack by Anoton
      Forgotten showcase.
      1. Add InteractionContainer::requestErase to hint colliders that wouldn't otherwise see !isReal interactions.     2. Use this logic in InsertionSortCollider, PersistentSAPCollider, SpatialQuickSortCollider (noop in the last one)     3. Add InsertionSortCollider::sortThenCollide to make it behave as non-persistent collider (for debugging only?)     4. Add Interaction::reset() that has common initialization code.     5. Assign zero inertia to utils.facet (better than uninitialized binary garbage)     6. Fix contact logic in Brefcom, finally I get the same results with InsertionSortCollider as with SpatialQuickSortCollider on large simulation (more fixes to come)     7. Do not install pkg-config; fixes compilation error reported by the build bot.
      1. Use bitfield instead of bools in InsertsionSortCollider     2. Revert accidental changes in insertion-sort-collider.py     3. Add function for using renamed classes from python with warning
      Getting rid of the Brefcom name, classes renamed as follows (moving files around  will follow)
      1. Add logic to scons to delete files that will not be installed in this run but are on-disk. This should make it unnecessary to remove files by hand. In the same way, disable implicit target cache which was making problems if files shuffle around.     2. Remove Brefcom* files, move to pkg/dem/ConcretePM.?pp. (not sure what other place, since it contains Engines, DataClasses etc in one file that I would refuse to break.).     3. Add detailed comments on ConcretePM to the ConcretePM.hpp     4. Remove extra/usct, moveUniaxialStrainer and put to pkg/dem; move SimpleScene from extra to pkg/dem     5. Remove core/yadeExceptions.*     6. Remove Preferences::dynLibDirectores and Preferences::version. Omega now recursively searches the lib directory for plugins and loads them. preferences.xml has only defaultGUILibName now. Finally. Remove baseDirs and other cruft from DynLibManager.
      2 forgotten files (separated from UniaxialStrainer before)
      1. Fix hopefully last relict of pkg-config     2. Degrade deleting non-existent interaction from fatal erro to warning only (not sure where that can come from, though.)
      Solve the cause of nonexistent interactions being deleted (after O.interactions.clear()). Make warning fatal error again.
      1. Remove Interaction::isNew, Interaction::isReal. Add Interaction::isReal() which test for presence of _both_ interactionGeometry and interactionPhysics and Interaction::isFresh() which checks the interaction creation timestamp against current iteration. Updated all code for that. Please verify that your stuff works, it is possible I made some mistakes!     2. All code saying isReal=false replaced by interaction->requestErase(id1,id2)     3. make requestErase thread-safe     4. Add interace for traversing interactions pending erase (template)     5. Add TriaxialTest::noFiles and TriaxialCompressionEngine::noFiles to not generate any files (default: off)     6. Add predicate utils.ptInAABB(p,minPt,maxPt)     7. utils.spheresToFile return number of spheres written (instead of None)     8. Add examples/concrete/pack to generate packing; other stuff in concrete will follow, with simplified version of the cpm model in ConcretePM.
      1. Syntax fixes in ConcretePM model     2. Interactions will be deleted also if the ye4xist, but geometry functor fails (returns false)     3. Add utils.approxSectionArea, utils.spheresFromFileUnixial (get some parameters useful for uniaxial tests from the sphere packing, such as cross-section, principal axis, etc)     4. Add lib/computational-geometry/Hull2d.hpp for computing convex hull in 2d using Graham scan algorithm (I know it is in CGAL already, but I don't want to depend on that commercial stuff)     5. Remove some unused stuff from utils.
      1. Add epsNPl to Cpm     2. Replace vector<body_id_t> by Vector2<body_id_t> and make it properly serializable (should be faster)     3. Add function to compute forces on interactions crossing plane.     4. Replace custom xcombine function by itertools.product in grid sphere packing
      Fixes and cleanups in the CPM code.
      Add new 'feature' to scons called openGL, which is on by default.     Qt3 GUI will not be built without openGL.     YADE_OPENGL is defined in openGL-enabled builds.     Sconscript files adapted to skip GL plugins or GL parts of plugins.
      1. Fix missing libs for linkage     2. Fix a few typos
      1. Don't link core with glut (is there a reason for that?)
      Do not include X11 headers if without opengl
      1. Move all python modules to PREFIX/lib/yadeSUFFIX/py/yade instead of */gui/yade     2. Add pack module for generating regular packings (thanks to Anton Gladky for his ideas & code)     3. Add _packPredicates module for solid inclusion testing.     4. Update regular-sphere-pack.py to test new packing features.
      Remove leftover reularSpheresOrthoPack from utils. Is in yade.pack now.
      Add pack.inHyperboloid predicate. Should be useful for cylindric specimen in uniaxial tension, but with the middle part having smaller diameter. Added to the test script as well.
      1. Fix (hopefully) clump damping     2. Remove unused code from InsertionSortCollider     3. Make SimulationController NOT change timestep (rounding) by just opening it (!!)     4. Fix paths in PythonUI and lib/SConscript for $PREFIX/yade$SUFFIX/py/yade instead of $PREFIX/yade$SUFFIX/gui/yade
      1. Add resetting interactionGeometry and interactionPhysics to Interaction::reset(), as it should be...     2. Small things in CPM     3. Add GaussAverage.data method to python (for debugging and plotting)
      Include Python.h in PythonRunnerFilter. Build this plugin only with EMBED_PYTHON.
      A few changes to allow run primarily python with qt3 on the top of that (open, close etc as needed). This paves way to running main yade process in python ;-) (just kidding, for now)
      1. Handle groupMasks of bodies in InteractionDispatchers directly (not in geometry functors etc).     2. Fixes for qt3 started from within python     3. Add Body().dynamic flag to the wrapper, instead of using Body()['isDynamic'] all the time.
      Anton's new things: axis-aligned ellipsoid predicate and fix in pack.regularHexa.
      1. Add external euclid.py module (suggested by Anton, thanks!) to our installation
      1. Propose *.sqlite ending for saved simulations instead of * in the player
      Fix error-tolerant law which uses no interactionPhysics: add void Interaction physics in the geometry functor if returning true, to make Interaction::isReal return true. (Shouldn't we remove ErrorTolerant...? Does it have some serious use?)
      1. Remove constructor priority for log4cxx to avoid syntax unsupported by gcc<=4.0.     2. Remove some commented cruft from FrictionLessElasticContactLaw
      1. Add boolean operators on solid predicates (&,|,^,-), shown in scripts/test/regular-sphere-pack.py     2. Add notch predicate (not functional yet)     3. Add utils.alignedFacetBox to create hollow box from facets. Shown in new file scripts/test/facet-box.py
      1. Update simulation filename in controller periodically     2. Fix notInNotch predicate, use infinite AABB for unbounded solids and raise exception in the packing generator if such is encountered.     3. Add notch to the head of regular-sphere-pack.py guy
      1. Add checks for GTS (optional)     2. Add pyGTS to our tree (built only if needed), since no packages are available.
      1. Fix corner case in InsertionSortCollider related to instability of std::sort (quicksort) and bodies having the same upper and lower bounds (facet in the xy plane, for example). Thanks to Anton for providing the crasher.
      Fix feature macro definitions (typos)
      1. Add GTS surface predicate     2. Add example of sphere horse falling onto facet horse in scripts/test/gts.py (try it!)     3. Predicate difference now takes padding in the inverse sense for the second predicate (logical)     4. Attempt to enable lightning on facets (no effect :-( )
      1. Add coarsened horse geometry for the example gts.py
      1. Rename ef2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_ElasticLaw to Law2_Dem3Dof_Elastic_Elastic (in scripts as well)
      1. Make virtual methods on pack.Predicate work in python (inGtsSurface, for instance). Add scripts/test/gts-operators.py to show that.     2. Move scripts/test/gts.py to gts-horse.py     3. Add a few functions to pack for constructing triangulated revolution surfaces from meridians.
      1. Padding support (though slow and not very precise) for pack.inGtsSurface
      1. Fix crashers in InteractingMyTetrahedron* classes (introduced by me when updating interaction logic)     2. Reimplement inGtsSurface in c/c++ which makes it faster due to pygts interface limitations (addressed on pygts mailing list meanwhile), but is dirty programming.     3. Set CCOMSTR to correspond to CXXCOMSTR in SConstruct (to show nice line when compiling c source file, for pygts)     4. Set good-looking timestep in the TetrahedronsTest generator
      1. Add triaxial packing generator, with optional memoization to sqlite database to avoid generating packing if there are suitable ones (same parameters/scalable to same parameters) available. Sample script will be provided soon. This allows for filling arbitrary (gts-defined, for example) volumes with irregular, high-quality sphere packing.     2. Add python-wrapped class SpherePack for manipulating sphere packings (loading, saving, spatial transformations, iterating)     3. Add shared_ptr<MetaBody> Omega::rootBodyAnother to be used with Omega().switchWorld()     4. Move some stuff from gui/py to lib/py, which is more logical hopefully     5. If negative value is specified for TriaxialTest::thickness, wall thickness will correspond to the mean sphere radius (avoids spheres going through the walls during compaction for some radii)
      1. Add automatic converter from python::tuple to Vector3r and vice versa. Wrapped functions can take/return Vector3r directly instead of manual conversion. Clean code that had to do that. Let me know if something breaks, the changes should not touch any python code.     2. Some preliminary work on wrapping Vector+Quaternion classes in python via py++ (not enabled, just the files are there)     3. Add forgotten _packSphere.cpp, thanks to Vincent for reporting.
      1. Add scripts/test/gts-traix-pack.py to demonstrate triaxial packing generator.
      Remove useless include in GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.
      1. Fix STUPID (my fault, sorry!!) mistake in setting Interaction::iterMadeReal, which cause ElasticContactLaw to function wrong. It concerns a few other contact laws calling isFresh, which would return true as well. Sorry again.
      1. Shuffling stuff around, moving most python things to py/     2. Wrapping Vector3r, Quaternionr and Vector2r in python directly, see scripts/wm3-wrap.py     3. Change the way utils.box, utils.sphere and utils.facet works: arguments to physical parameters are passed as keywords, not as dictionary now (update your old code by passing **dict instead of dict as the last argument)     4. Fix a bug with useShear, now getting almost identical results for triaxial again.     5. Preliminary Triaxial::facetWalls, to be able to used Dem3DofGeom with Triaxial. (not fully functional yet)     6. TriaxialStressController::thickness is -1 by default now (get thickness from box width), as 0 is real value for Facets. Doesn't change beahvior in any way.
      1. Update triax-perf.py     2. Add Omega().tmpToString returning string of :memory: saved simluation
      1. add yade.plot.resetData(), which unlike reset() resets just data     2. Add scripts/test/compare-identical.py to run 2 simulations at the same time and check at every step (configurable) if they differ or not.     3. Add active=active line to GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper, which for some reason causes two same simulations to be the same. Any explanation someone??
      1. Add forgotten py/SConscript (sorry!)
      1. Fix absolute path generated by py++
      1. Dump XML in ConcretePM in case of problems (nan's)     2. InteractingFacet::postProcessAttributes gives FATAL message if there are coincident vertices     3. Update triax-perf, add script and openoffice sheet to make table     4. InsertionSortCollider is used in TriaxialTest always (not only with fast) now.
      1. Change prototype of Engine::isActivated() to Engine::isActivate(MetaBody*)     2. Add maxVelocitySq to NewtonsDampedLaw for analysis purposes     3. Add BoundingVolumeMetaEngine::sweepTime and ::sweepDist to sweep bounding volume by given predicted motion over time or by given absolute distance.     4. Add strided run support to InsertionSortCollider (using sweeping)     5. Add scripts/test/collider-stride-triax.py to play with the strategies of sweeping based on strides     6. Add O.interactions.countReal()
      1. Fix collider-stride.py to match changed parameters. (it is quite useless now, anyway
      1. Make NewtonsDampedLaw compute maxVlocitySq at every step anew.     2. Make InsertionSortCollider find NewtonsDampedLaw and get max speed from there. Together with InsertionSortColider::sweepLength, this makes stride adapted automatically to maxVelocitySq; this will described at http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Insertion_Sort_Collider_Stride.     3. Update test script for that.
      1. Handle clumps in a better way in NewtonsDampedLaw (only if asked by the clump itself) -- future parallelization work. (related to bug #398086)     2. InsertionSortCollider now knows when to run based on maximum distance the fastest body could have travelled. (It is actually the physical meaning of sweepDistance). Handle varying maxVelocitySq in a constitent way.     3. Add InteractionContainer::serializeSorted to sort interactions by id1 and id2 before serializing (useful for comparing XML files). Added Interaction::operator< to compare 2 interactions in that way.     4. Fix openMP strategy in InteractionDispatchers to "guided" (as per https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/omp-schedule-strategy)
      1. Remove doc/removed, it is in SVN history     2. Tune debian scripts to install docs+examples+scripts instead of headers (targets https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/398174, but not yet finished)     3. Add depends on python-numpy instead of python-scientific packages for debian     4. Add ../py directory to doxygen (targets bug #398190)
      1. Change NewtonsDampedLaw to a StandAloneEngine     2. add .updateExistingKeys (perhaps should be updateExistingAttributes) to all python-wrapped yade objects, which will change only existing attributes from given dictionary     3. Adapt STLImporterTest to new nicer syntax.
      1. Add virtual destructors to all EngineUnits so that they can by dynamic_cast'ed to. This fixes possible crash from python, bug #398255     2. Rename updateExistingKeys to updateExistingAttrs, add updateAttrs.     3. Add forgotten script to demonstrate predicate operators     4. The default debug level is -ggdb2 (instead of -ggdb3). Libs are about 60% in size and still give the same debug information.
      1. Rename scons option arcs to PGO (profile=guided optimizations)     2. Install only binaries by default (no docs, must be requested from cmd line via path)
      1. Various fixes related to generating debian packages
      1. Fix EngineUnits linkage for SImpleViscoelasticRelationships
      1. Add velocity binning for collision optimization: requires cooperation of NewtonsDampedLaw, BoundingVolumeMetaEngine and InsertionSortCollider.     2. Remove time-based sweeping from BoundingVOlumeMetaEngine.     3. QtGUI doesn't show annoying warning when run from python session anymore.
      1. Parallelized NewtonsDampedLaw (scales very well)     2. Parallelized VelocityBins     3. Add const modifier to BodyContainer::size     4. Add virtual dtors to PhysicalAction{Damper,Applier}Unit (for dynamic_cast'ing)
      1. Move NewtonsDampedLaw to StandAloneEngine directory     2. Add omp critical to ConcretePM     3. Remove SphericalDEMSimulator
      1. Add sweepLength to TriaxialTest if fast==true     2. Remove euclid from the pack module, since we use wrapped wm3 now.     3. Add _packObb.cpp to compute minimal oriented bounding box on cloud of points     4. inGtsSurface predicate with triaxialPack will work on the minimum OBB     5. Add check for engine to prevent crash as per https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/399810     6. Enhance the pack.inSpace predicate to work as expected. Custom center can be given to the ctor
      1. Fix non-tuple in graph specification     2. Allow plotting agains the y2 axis, after a special parameter '|||'.
      1. Remove mutex from requestErase (should be verified to compile on non-openMP machine!)     2. Add mutex to PhysicalParameters, so that body state can be locked while updating from the interaction loop.     3. Add linking with EngineUnits to Tetra (thans Emanuelle)
      why..??
      1. Adapt simple-scene-graph.py to new instance syntax     2. Add support to y2axis to saved gnuplot plots     3. Change interface for yade.plot.addData to take **kw instead of straight dict (still backwards-compatible)
      1. Do not use REGISTER_ATTRIBUTE anymore, use REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES instead everywhere. This generates (in addition to serialization code) also some python code and makes python independent on the yade serialization framework (Janek, if you want to try boost::serialization, I have no objections now).
      1. Remove garbage from doc     2. Instruct getopt to not shuffle command-line arguments, so that their order is preserved     3. Add epydoc documentation for all python classes and functions
      1. Fix linking logic for _packPredicates (fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/401029)     2. Make gts-horse coarse original horse automatically
      Fix small bug in Velocity bins related to max sweep length (should improve performance as well). Still some incorrect things WRT bboxes, it seems.
      1. Fix mathematical error with VelocityBins, verified by new script scripts/test/collider-sweep-simple.py to be correct     2. Add py/ directory to skipped dirs for linkdeps.py so that it works on current trunk
      1. BIG CHANGE: pkg/ no longer have SConscript files but are scanned at startup for plugins. See http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ImplicitBuilds for some details. Let me know if there are some problems.
      add boost-serialization and boost-program-options to debian.
      1. Move STILimport to pkg/dem, as it depends on dem     2. update RockPM with the new-old version (probably svn didn't update the moved version? what a deal. We should definitely move to bzr...)
      1. Fix unreported version for the debian build
      1. Fix snow compilation by #including Voxel/* files in SnowVoxeslLoader and noc compiling them directly (sorry)     2. STLReader is a pure-header import lib now, tolerance is passed as regular data member.     3. Fix all warnings in ConcretePM.     4. Merge lib/yade-* into lib/yade-support.
      1. Fix monolithic compilation even with fem. All modules can now be compiled that way.
      fix compilation?
      Fix TetraTestGen crasher (functionally still brokne, though)
      Remove SDECLinkGeometry, replaced by SpheresContactGeometry at a few places. Not checked for functionality. This avoid many warnings.
      1. Fix linking with full Wm3 library     2. Automatically add /usr/include/wm3 to CPPPATH if useMiniWm3=False
      1. Hopefully fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/402098     2. Fast in TriaxialTest uses nBins==5 and binCoeff==2 for VelocityBins
      1. Fix SnapshotEngine and simple-scene-video.py to run. It doesn't work, though, because of the makeCurrent() failed error (probably getting snapshot from another thread...)
      1. Add GLViewer::nextFrameSnapshotFilename to save frame in postDraw     2. Adjust SnapshotEngine to take advantage of that. This should solve https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/396023     3. utils.encodeVideoFromFrames can take list of files (instead of just wildcard). Backwards-compatible.     4. scons doc skips debian/ directory (would mess up if deb package was build)
      1. Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/406343 (at least for me)
      1. Add GenericSpheresContactClass to unit radius1, radius2 and normal between SpheresContactGeometry and Dem3DofGeom (to make it work with GlobalSitffnessTimeStepper). Partially solves https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/399963
      1. Add docstrings to all wrapper.Omega() methods     2. Fix a few warnings.
      Fix has_map warning and one more in FlowEngine.
      1. Add infrastructure for getting temporary filenames in a secure manner to Omega     2. move selectedBOyd to MetaBody; initialize it properly to avoid possible crash.
      Remove leftover SConscripts.
      1. Change syntax of YADE_PLUGIN("Plugin1","Plugin2") to YADE_PLUGIN((Plugin1)(Plugin2)) (replaced everywhere)     2. Add some perliminary and not-enabled by default support for boost::serialization (see ClassFactory.hpp)     3. Add boost::serialization code for Se3r, Vector2r, Vector2<int>, Quaternionr     4. Do not reset BexContainer's moves and rotations uselessly (i.e. if not used)     5. Use Omega's mutex in SimulationController to prevent loading-related crashes
      1. Don't use __COUNTER__ to generate plugin registration function names, as they wre added in gcc 4.3 Use the name of the first plugin instead.     2. Dem3Dof_SphereSphere takes touching distance as equilibrium if distanceFactor is <=1. The initial position otherwise (was the default everytime until now)
      1. Generate proxy constructors to all classes deriving only from Serializable in python (like GLDrawBox and similar).     2. Fix scripts to have the new syntax everywhere, since e.g. EngineUnit is just abstract class that cannot be instantiated from python.     3. Add check fro valid data before saving plot to gnuplot; raise comprehensible exception if there is nothing to save.     4. Remove leftover scripts/pch.py
      1. Add an example of uniaxial tension-compression test for concrete (ready long time ago...)
      1. All different yade types are real python types now. They have their properties defined at startup. One can say O.bodies[0].shape.diffuseColor instead of O.bodies[0].shape['diffuseColor'] now. It also works much better with ipython tab-completion. It is not sure whether we will be able ever to deprecate the old object['attribute'] syntax.     2. Wrap ParallelEngine in python, and finish Dispatcher wraps as well.
      1. Reset interaction radius after the initial contacts have been created.
      Fix FileGenerator wrapper in PythonUI_rc.py (has different name in c++ (FileGenerator) and python (Preprocessor).
      1. Rename Preprocessor in python to FileGenerator, to be consistent with c++. Preprocessor is never used directly, anyway. The old deprecated name put in the deprecation table.     2. Manage crash at exit in defaut-test gracefully     3. Fix serialization of pairs (overlooked replace)
      1. Initial attempt at regression tests (only the python wrapper so far); run scripts/regression-tests.py     2. Fix a few bugs discovered that way :-)
      1. Replace PersistentSAPCollider and DistantPersistentSAPCollider by InsertionSortCollider everywhere. The two are still in the sources, but are not compiled. Will be removed in near future. Added to deprecated table in python so that old scripts still work.     2. Add some more regression tests for the python wrapper.     3. Fix timestep in HangingCloth (it does some weird things, can someone check it or just remove mass-spring from the tree?)
      1. Be more tolerant to specifying invalid GUI at the command line     2. Throw exception about unopenable $DISPLAY rather than letting QApplication abort()
      1. Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/409254
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/409254 take 2
      Maybe fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/409365
      1. Fix (?) https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/409254 by moving ClumpTestGen out of Clump.hpp     2. Avoid warnings in STL import code (return values _should_ be checked, though!)     3. Avoid warning in yade.cpp in optimized build
      1. Infrastructure for periodic collision handling. Not at all functional at this moment, don't even try to use.
      1. Beta version of periodic boundary conditions (try scripts/test/periodic-simple.py
      1. Assign new function O.exitNoBacktrace to sys.exit. Fixes partially https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/410250     2. Add some more comments to periodic stuff.
      1. Script that shrinks the periodic cell progressively (reveals bugs in the collider, though ;-) )     2. Add function to compute total force in volume from interactions to Shop, wrapped in _utils as well.
      1. Working periodic collider, yay!! scripts/test/periodic-grow.py shows that     2. A few changes related to that.
      1. Add PeriIsoCompressor for periodic isotropic compression; see scripts/test/periodic-compress.py. Not so much slower than regular triax, nice surprise.     2. Make SpherePack standalone class (previously just in python's _packSpheres), add the function to generate cloud of spheres, both periodic and non-periodic. _packSpheres wrapper is update, but otherwise not changed.     3. Fix python-less compilation for se3 interpolator engine     4. Add Omega().runEngine()     5. Fix some compilation/linking issues.
      1. Fix missing vtable for GenericSphereContact (crasher with debugging)     2. Fix collider stride for TriaxialTest with unspecified radius
      1. Try to fix locking with boost-1.35, possibly fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/411572 (please confirm)     2. Add periodic repetition function to SpherePack
      1. Fix linkage for boost<=1.34 (hopefully)
      1. Fix a few things in SpherePack     2. Remove TriaxialTest::GenerateCloud, replaced by SpherePack::makeCloud     3. Fix crash in BoundingVolumeMetaEngine, if MetaBody has no boundingVolume     4. Improve sorting operator, remove workarounds for std::sort wrapping minima/maxima (https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/402098)     5. Limit minimum cell width in PeriIsoCompressor, to not crash.     6. Add code for periodic packs in pack.triaxialPack (not yet fully functional)
      1. Add #pragma once to SpherePack.hpp (possibly cause of https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/412442)     2. Fix crash in TetraTestGen (finally, I think), closing https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/408422     3. Add highlight parameter to utils.{facet,sphere,box}, passed to Body::geometricalModel
      1. Fix assertion is 2d dispatch code, add indices to RpmPhys, RpmMat, CpmPhys, CpmMat (would break dispatching if using more classes derived from the same base in the dispatch matrix)
      1. Remove {,Distant}PersistentSAPCollider and Fixed{Position,Orientation}Engine classes     2. Add test script for generating packing
      1. Summarize important changes since the last release. Add your own things, if they are important for everybody (svn log has the small details)
      1. Add scripts/rename-class.py for renaming classes (replaces in code, moves files with bzr, adds rename record to python). Not very well tested, though.     2. Remove core/StandAloneSimulator.*pp (not used anymore)
      Add ignore patterns so that bzr st doesn't show (some) generated files
      1. Merged upstream changes.
      1. Clen the plugin loading logic a little (no nominal win32 support), support YADE_PREFIX for changing prefix (should be runtime-detected inthe future, anyway)     2. Use $ORIGIN in rpath to make yade relocatable; it can be fragile, let me know if there are troubles!     3. Add make check to the debian package (will be tested soon)
      1. Add compatibility for hardy     2. Fix missing newlines (hardy compiler gives warning)
      Adjust rpath for the main executable (ugly hack)
      Run tests in debian package (not failing if the test crashes, though, for now)
      1. IMPORTANT! All features are lower-cased now (avoids mess: openGL or OpenGL etc). This will probably break your profile files.     2. IMPORTANT! openmp is one of features, no longer a separate options. Adjust your profiles     3. Rename LOG4CXX to YADE_LOG4CXX; all features now #define YADE_FEATURE macros     4. Better $ORIGIN syntax in scons     5. Abort yade if running PythonUI_rc.py fails     6. Adjust pbuilder script
      1. Add wrapper for running tests, to trap exit segfault at squeeze     2. Use the wrapper for tests in debian/control     3. Add wrapper for vector<Se3r>
      Make the test script report what distribution failed (currently only karmic).
      Fix GTS features (thanks for spotting that; we need regression tests for all the modules)
      1. Skip more stuff in doxygen, a few warnings     2. Add debugging code to DynLibDispatcher (disabled)
      1. Rewrite 2d dispatching code from scratch     2. Expose classIndex to python for indexable classes     3. scripts/test-sphere-facet.py shows how the dispatch matrix fills with data
      Add python 2.5 compatibility hack
      Avoid error in pack.triaxialTest if compiled without GTS.
      1. PeriIsoCompressor: add keepProportions parameter (on by default), decrease global updates interval.     2. Omega: startSimulationLoop warns if there is no simulationLoop (how can that happen? It somehow can)     3. SpherePack: resets periodicity (and warns) if being rotated; cellSize is writable now.     4. pack.triaxialPack: renamed to pack.randomDensePack; fix loads of stuff in that; rename radiusStDev parameter to rRelFuzz; add epydoc documentation; fix erroneous detection of inGtsSurface being defined     5. wrapper: lock renderer when adding list of bodies; Omega().resetThisWorld to reset current world only.     6. Fix scripts/test/{gts-random-pack.py,gts-random-obb.py}
      ef2_Sphere_Sphere_Dem3Dof: change meaning of distanceFactor, see docs (if < 0, equilibrium is sum of radii, otherwise the initial distance; defaults to -1). Renamed to distFactor, to break old code intentionally     InteractingSphere2AABB: allow negative aabbEnlargeFactor, which doesn't scale aabb at all (same as if it is 1.)     yade-multi: use the first non-blank line as column headings (not necessarily the first line of the file, as is used to be)     SpatialQuickSortCollider: fix clearing interaction with openMP     examples/concrete/uniaxial: move files around, add confinement and docs; remove examples/concrete/pack since not in the pack module (an example should be given, though)     examples/collider-perf: remove PersistentSAPCollider, add InsertionSortCollide with strides, but commented out since no effect at hthe beginning of simulation     PeriodicInsertionSortCollider: remove unnecessary (hopefully) condition that would abort in scripts/test/periodic-simple.py
      PeriIsoCompressor: fix absolute displacements changing proportions, operate on averages instead     pack.randomDensePack: fix proportions in periodic packs; change residual stress to 1e8 instead of 1e9
      SConstruct: remove obsolete (unused) standalone openmp option
      yadeWrapper: Fix compilation with boost<1.35 (again)
      (now?)
      1. Fix startup crash if no $DISPLAY set at all
      miniWm3Wrap: update with newer py++; still errors out at karmic     spirit: avoid warning with newer boost versions
      Add gts to depends on the script.
      Remove unnecessary inclusion of indexing_suite which breaks compilation for boost<1.34 (or something like that).
      utils.uniaxialTestFeatures: fix compat with py2.5     SConstruct: fix compilation issues with older symlinks in include dirs
      Fix OperationalError, reported by Janek in https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/416906
      SConstruct: add doc for pretty, fix a few lib checks on karmic
      Fix version detection on systems where version is not specified by hand or in RELEASE file and bzr is not installed
      main: disable SIGHUP handler (emergency save) and automatic loading.
      1. Remove garbage from examples.     2. Fix SpheresFactory, fix examples/SpheresFactory/model.py
      move SpheresFactor to scripts/test as it doesn't work. Add notes to changelog and news.
      Forgotten file
      Mark release version
      Add mill script mimicking http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=005rdDBoe4w     Some changes in qt interface (useless)     Add series to package version to allow same version for multiple series in the ppa (0.20-1~hardy, 0.20-1~karmic etc)
      Added script for http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUv26xlh89I
      1. Fix facet lighting, mill shown with wire=False now (looks better)     2. Revert recent useless change in QtGUI-python
      1. Enabling O.timingEnabled when running will not produce garbage values for current engine anymore     2. Add maxRefRelStep to VelocityBins, to limit speed fo maximum velocity changes     3. Fix epydoc format for utils.encodeVideoFromFrames and utils.uniaxialTestFeatures
      1. Do not save potential-only interactions to the XML; do not save pendingErase interactions (are only potential)     2. Do not save interactions in SQLiteRecorder by default (saveInteractions=True if you want the old behavior)     3. Add slider to the simulation player, in the "snaps" tab
      1. Add scene that has been sitting here for a few days (should be run for comparison with pfc3d)
      Workaround bug #416335; static members of Vector3 work only on instance, e.g. Vector3.ZERO will not work, you have to use Vector3().ZERO; changed all occurences in the code accordingly, update your scripts as well.\n2.Some undocumented and untested enhancements for parameter table (backwards compatible)

      A wrong comment on contact laws in PFC3D is removed.
      svn update - no real change (in principle)  - recovering from erased local file
      - Fix conflicts and prepare next implementation of isotropic compression
      - Few files missing in the previous commit.     - Add a new class for computing/recording micromechanical data based on     tesselation
      Still recovering from conflicted files... I hope this is the last one.
      A class with algorithm for analysing contacts-forces-displacements     statistics. Using the triangulation lib.

Janek Kozicki (14):
      ouch, forgot to mark INSTALL file as outdated. We need to update it.
      some cleanup in the files
      fix crashes of this->parentWidget()->parentWidget() in UI
      yade.cpp: more detailed info about compilation flags.     LatticeExample: added material parameters bond zone between steel fibres and cement matrix
      update to use latest scons 1.0.0
      don't refresh display when there's nothing to refresh
      support for generating multiple file with single NullGUI call
      add to SimulationController buttons for looking in different directions. The default view direction is now down along the direction of gravity.
      improved generation of steel fibres in lattice
      fixed snaphotNames in NullGUI for .xml.gz
      more configurable MakeItFlat,     TriaxialTest can be now a biaxial test as well.     small fixes in UIs
      make it compile with boost 1.35 (I wonder what 1.36 will bring)
      Fixed OpenGL problems with displaying spheres, which      - never occurred on my desktop      - I've seen them sometimes on other peoples computers, but never could reproduce them      - but finally have appeared on my laptop.
      up direction on Y     release 0.12.1

Jerome Duriez (7):
      Added :     - Engines for simulating shear tests at constant normal displacement, normal stress or normal rigidity (CinemDNCEngine, CinemCNCEngine and CinemKNCEngine) for samples     deriving from SimpleShear PreProcessor (added also, former DirectShearCis)     - ContactLaw1 : a contact law with Moment Transfer and inelastic behaviour in compression : see comments. With correspondant Relationships and type of Interactions.     NB : sorry for the name : i didn't search too long for a more explicit one but I think personly that the comments in the files (and I tried to put some) are far much better     than the one
      - Add of the paragraph for the CL1Relationships, which was forgotten, in the corresponding SConscript
      A (last ?) error concerning last revision in the paragraph CL1Relationships : "CL1Interaction" does not exist, that's ContactLaw1Interaction
      -ContactLaw1 : correction of prototype of action() : it needed a body, whereas now action methods of Engines need a Metabody. This led the simulation to crash and is     now fixed     - SimpleShear : now all is normaly done so that this preprocessor could be used (with success) with this ContactLaw. Moreover it is now linked to the     GlobalStifnessTimeStepper (instead of the ElasticOne)
      Suppress of some useful comments (sorry for the extra mail)
      (At last) The good Sconscript file
      - The GlobalStifnessCounter engine (for correct use of GlobalStifnessTimeStepper) was forgotten in the preprocessor SimpleShear...

Sergei Dorofeenko (4):
      1. A new algorithm for facets. It use only a class Facet, so classes Vertex and Edge are deprecated and has been removed.     2. Add functions to python gui for import geometry from stl and for creating facets.     3. Add Shop::inscribedCircleCenter for calculate position of center of triangle inscribed circle (use it for set facet's se3.position).     4. ForceRecorder now take cary about old data files and renaming them.     5. SimulationPlayer now allow wire body form view tab.
      1. ResetPositionEngine is now inherited from PeriodicEngine.     2. Add examples/rod_penetration model and geometry.
      small fixes
      1. New random-access interaction container InteractionVecMap (rewrited from  InteractionVecSet)     2. Fixes: default initialization some attributes in SCG and IS2IS4SCG

Unknown (2):
      I added a new state at the triaxial compression test in order to realize isotropic compression by the walls displacement until a indicated porosity value. These modifications can be seen with generator file "TriaxialCompression" in the last three parameters (added).
      I corrected my errors on the triaxialtest files.Moreover, i added comments in the TriaxialCompressionEngine.hpp.

Vincent Richefeu (4):
      - initialize radius in InteractingSphere constructor.     - add new plugins used for membrane modelling.
      - add GLDraw plugin for BssSweptSphereLineSegment displaying
      - 'Membrane' (in fact geogrid) has been improved but still doesn't work...     - the class GroupRelationData has been add (not used yet) to define interacting parameters such as coefficient of friction or restitution that have nothing to do in the bodies parameters (in my opinion)
      - forgotten files

Václav Šmilauer (44):
      Move big news to NEWS, ready for release finally (?)
      Update INSTALL file from wiki (brief instructions only).
      1. Reimplement some loop-intensive functions from yade.utils in c++ for better performance (as yade._utils, imported into yade.utils automatically - transparent to the user)     2. Add poisson's ratio and Young's modulus estimation in yade.eudoxos based on linear regressions of position→displacement mapping along different axes     3. Rename Shop::ElasticWaveTimestepEstimate to Shop::PWaveTimeStep, wrapped in yade.utils
      1. Add python interface for blocking DOFs:     		b.phys.blockedDOFs=['z','rx','ry']     	It is friendlier than b.phys['blockedDOFs']=1<<2|1<<3|1<<4.     	The property is read-write.
      1. Add code for computing histogram of interaction directions in given plane in _utils.     2. This is code is used by yade.eudoxos.plotDirections() to create the actual (nice) figure.
      1. Skip (almost) exactly zero projections, implement masking of bodies.
      1. poisson and young estimator now works on a fractional part of the speciment     2. do not switch ui automatically if selected explcitly     3. body::maskOK to check mask
      1. eudoxos module cleanups, young estimator arg chages     2. fix harmless compiler warning in _utils.cpp
      1. add utility function to compute elastic energy within a volume (the dynamic_cast to NormalShearInteraction still fails; what is going on?)     2. add utils.fractionalBox, an AABB reduced to its fraction     3. fix fixmes in Force and Momentum about unused functions about to be deleted     4. plotting interaction direction histogram now works on contrained volume (to study boundary influence on the distribution)
      1. Beginning hijacking SpheresContactGeometry to hold more elaborate geometry characteristics, such as relative shear displacement. By default, those parameters are neither calculated nor displated (exactRot==False; must be set to True in ISphere2ISphere4SpheresContactGeometry to enable it). Test script is in scripts/exact-rot.py     2. Remove deprecated code from UniaxialStrainController     3. Add GLUtils to draw lines, text, numbers -- copid over from Shop     4. Add operator<< for Quatrnions (axis angle)     5. Fix energy calculation in volume (in _utils.cpp)     6. Other fixes here and there...
      1. The exactRot code is reasonably verified now to be functional, including rolling correction (SpheresContactGeometry::relocateContactPoints) and will used in brefcom soon.     2. Updated the "testing" script scripts/exact-rot.py, as a showcase as well.
      1. Remove GL things from Shop, moved to lib/opengl/GLUtils.hpp     2. Cleanup of SpheresContactGeometry code, rename exactRot to hasShear
      (I thought most of this was already commited?!)     1. Delete unused IS2IS4DistantSpheresContactGeometry (merged with IS2IS4SCG), adapt existing code     2. Adapt new facet code to updated SpheresContactGeometry (only superficially tested) so that     they can interact using BrefcomLaw; add scripts/exact-rot-facet.py to show that.     3. Fix a few missing loggers in others' commits.     4. SimulationController redraws if iteration changes (the +1 button would otherwise not cause redraw)     5. Remove cruft from Brefcom.     6. Fix inheritance (dynamic casts) of NormalShearInteraction and of BrefcomPhysParams     7. Remove cruft from UniaxialStrainer     8. Add some python code to compute stress from stored elastic energy.
      1. Move interaction direction distribution pie histograms to utils     2. Add plotting histogram of number of contacts to plotDirections()
      1. Omega().bodies.append can take list of bodies now (instead of just one body), returning list of added id's     2. utils.facet can take both tuples and lists for vertex coordinates
      1. Add NormalInteraction::normalForce and NormalShearInteraction::normalForce (moved up the hierarchy from ElasticContactInteraction) so that unbalancedForce can be calculated on any subclassed interaction type.     2. Adapt Brefcom for this.     3. Add Shop::unbalancedForce and utils.unbalancedForce     4. Add workaround for saving ipython history as suggested by http://lists.ipython.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-user/2008-September/005839.html     5. Fix AxialGravityEngine to register parent class attributes.
      1. Avoid compiler warning in optimized builds from pyOmega     2. Body containers now allocate the lowest possible ID for each added body. The old behavior was to allocate the first free ID greater than the ID of the body, if it was already set. Please let me know if this is critical for someone. We can do things like:
      1. 3d view now has by default a OSD with iteration number, simulation time and virtual time. This can be toggled (all combinations) by pressing 'D' (which used to mean toggling d+ynamic flag...?) and set also from python with GLView.timeMask='rvi' (Real,Virtual,Iteration) and so on.     2. Simulation player displays real time and wall clock loaded from db (insted of bogus values of system clock when the player is being run)     3. new periodic SnapshotEngine that takes snapshots of any GL view to numbered PNG files.     4. new function qt.makeSimulationVideo that makes video _while running the simulation_.     5. qt.createVideo renamed to qt.makePlayerVideo     6. Added Omega method to query computation duration.     7. An example of using qt.makeSimulationVideo is in new file scripts/simple-scene-video.py
      1. Add forgotten SnapshotEngine     2. BodyRedirectionVector always really find the lowest unused ID (the same for BodyAssocVector)     3. add Omega().interactions.clear() in python     4. Move the "Less than 500 bodies, moving possible" to LOG_INFO instead of on-screen since it disturbs videos taken during simulation...
      A few fixes in TriaxialTest:     1. radiusStdDev is a registered attribute parameter     2. skip unloading phase if sigmaLateralConfinement==sigmaIsoCompaction     3. new bool autoUnload, that controls automaticity of going from compaction to unloading; autocompressionActivation controls from unloading to loading.     Note: IFacet2IS4SCG is broken, but not yet fixed.
      1. TriaxialTest now takes readiusMean argument (by default negative, i.e. disabled); if >0, box size is scaled so that both requested porosity and mean size can be preserved.     2. Attempt to fix computation of stress from stored elastic energy.
      1. Fix adding empty engine if record wall stress interval <= 0 in TriaxialTest (bug introduced yesterday)
      1. Add Interaction::swapOrder(), for use in EngineUnits that want to avoid calling goReverse()     2. SnapshotEngine can sleep specified number of msecs after shot, which probably can avoid some hw problems (make_current failed in mesa, freezes etc)     3. InteractingFacet2IS4SCG now works "correctly" (not exactly physically, though) with shear     4. DynLibDispatcher should report names of classes if dispatch fails.
      1. Add InteractionGeometryMetaEngine::explicitAction and InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine::explicitAction for creating contacts manually using the dispatcher     2. add utils.createInteraction(id1,id2) that requests explicit transient interaction creation     3. Add sample ElasticContactLaw2 (in ElasticContactLaw.cpp) that uses new SpheresContactGeometry code and can be used for "persistent" (transient but not deleted by the collider) contacts.     4. Add Shop::applyForceAtContactPoint (applies contact force at contact point to both bodies (reversed for body2) and moments acting on their cenroids as well)     5. All the previous new functionality is demonstrated in scripts/chain-distant-interactions.py.
      1. Add Omega().reload()     2. Create map<string,string> Omega::memSavedSimulations, where simulations are saved if they begin with special sequence ":memory:" and can be loaded again, within lifetime of Omega.     3. Add Omega().tmpLoad() and Omega().tmpSave() that use the above mentioned thing.     4. add utils.readParamsFromTable that reads any python variables from text file (useful for automatic parametric studies)     5. Add less expensive routine for sontact point relocation in SpheresContactGeometry
      1. Separate player into two windows (controller and the 3d view); the controller may be hidden with ::hide() (and ::show()) or with Alt-H from the 3d view. This allows for correctly restoring 3d view size. Closing any of the two closes the player. Please log crashes, if any.     2. Update QtGUI-python.cpp: runPlayerSession
      1. Yade now runs TCP server at the first free port above 9000 (accessible from localhost only), which simulates python console. (let me know if you need this over network -- it is DANGEROUS, since someone can delete all your files etc without any authentication). The interpreter has its own namespace.
      1. Fix crasher (under special circumstances) in PersistentSAPCollider (deletion invalidating iterator)     2. PeriodicEngine now takes nDo and nDone attributes, limitng number of activations     3. Fix minor things is BrefcomDamageColorizer, add normalized damage to BrefcomPhysParams     4. Fix some indents in Triaxial
      Fix stupid sign mistake when applying contact force in brefcom.
      1. PythonTCPServer now generates random 6-letter cookie (password) at startup and authenticates all connections by that cookie.     It can be retrieved from yade.runtime.cookie
      1. Add Body().mask in python     2. Add PhysicalParameters().pos and .ori instead of ugly pp['se3'][:3] and pp['se3'][3:]     3. Add dmgPlane plot in brefcom     4. Do not delete renderer if we close the last view (loses all renderer settings)
      1. Add a quick implementation of bending and torsion code to SpheresContactGeometry     2. Update ElasticContactLaw2 to use that code; stiffnesses are hard-coded for now.     3. Update scripts/chain-distant-interactions.py to show that that code really works     4. Plot residual strength instead of damage in brefcom     5. Add some functions for spiral projections (not correctly working yet)     6. Fix missing std:: in DisplayParameters
      1. Add 2d weighted average smoothing abstract class and its specialization on symmetric gaussian kernel, with python glue of course.     2. Remove .gz support.     3. Fix some bugs in the spiral projection code.
      1. Fix errors preventing compilation due to missing TesselationWrapper.
      !! IMPORTANT !! Introduced new dependency on "python-numpy" package     (numpy/ndarrayobject.h header), which is now checked for by scons.     Tell me if this is not OK!
      1. Add initializers for all SpheresContactGeometry members, to avoid nan's in the .xml file     2. Add code for saving arbitrary python variables within the .xml file, see documentation on utils.saveVars() and utils.loadVars()     3. Fix error (hopefully) caused by dangling symlinks in the symlinked buildDir/include tree
      1. Fix algebraic typo in max distance check.
      1. Commit simple parametric study interface, documented at http://yade.wikia.com/index.php?title=ScriptParametricStudy and wrapper script to queue jobs, which is installed as yade-trunk-multi, yade-trunk-opt-multi and so on.     2. Examples of such parametric "study" added in scripts/multi.py and scripts/multi.table     3. MetaBody now create Omega().tags['id'] at initialization like '20081028T102950p15498' (date, time, pid) that is unique
      1. Changed colors to be random by default on utils.{sphere,box,facet}
      1. Make our intelligence-challenged deserializer finally gracefully handle nan, inf, -inf (arbitrary lower-upper case).     2. Fix crash in MembraneTest (leftover in the commit from testing, oh well)     3. Add TriaxialTest::fixedBoxDims to not scale selected box dimensions if sphere mean radius is given (example underway).
      1. experimental support for Real==long double (#defines QUAD_PRECISION, scons quad=1). long double is not necessarily quadruple precision (not on IA32, at least) though, but is still more precise than double. (search "long double" on wikipedia)     2. Some preparation to compile with -std=c++0x (not yet functional) WRT <boost/shared_ptr.hpp> and boost::shared_ptr vs. <memory> and std::shared_ptr     3. Fixed in yade-multi.     4. New direct oofenm exporter in yade.eudoxos.     5. Don't fiddle with termios in non-interactive sessions.
      1. Add INTEGER (besides FLOAT) to the list of wrapped c++ types in python. Fix type detection for long double     2. Fix Real->double conversions in GLDrawBssSweptSphereLineSegment.cpp
      1. Body().phys.refPos is directly accessible now (old way Body().phys['refSe3'[0:3]] still works, though)     2. Labeled engines are at load-time or when Omega().engines are modified assigned to variables __builtins__.label;       for example
      Add forgotten file.

yade-0.12.0
Wed, Aug 20 14:37:02 2008 +0000

Janek Kozicki (8):
      testing if SVN commit messages can go to launchpad
      eliminate crash on simulation reload. commented out line 241 in QtFileGenerator.cpp
      some small bugfixes that allow all non-broken filegenerators to run. Those based on SDECLinks will never work, so just put "return false;" there to indicate failure.
      use NDEBUG to detect optimized builds in FEMBeam and HangingCloth
      small changes in Lattice     small bugfix in scons (by Vaclav)
      No idea why dynamic_cast fails while static_cast works in TriaxialCompressionEngine:275 and GlobalStiffnessCounter:63 when casting to NormalShearInteraction. We will use static_cast for now...
      New ChangeLog format. Now I will update with older revisions. But next time     it's ALL OF YOU who will write this ChangeLog. It's not nice to write 200     entries once per year.
      Release 0.12 is ready

Sergei Dorofeenko (1):
      Fixed small bugs and misprints

Václav Šmilauer (22):
      1. Remove unused GLViewer4     2. Add fairly straightforward GLViewer wrapper (manually wrapped)     3. Fix scripts/simple-scene-player.py that generates video     4. yade.qt module is now in python and imports * from yade._qt for the binary wrappers     5. importing qt if qt not running raises ImportError     6. utils.qtCreateVideo moved to qt.CreateVideo     7. Exponential softening in brefcom (untested)
      1. DECREASED Mathr::ZERO_TOLERANCE to 1e-20 so that we don't get identity quaternions for small rotation in ToAxisAngle (!!)     2. Add glue for GLViewer, currently may crash, probably concurrency issues there     3. added yade.plot.reset()     4. add data smoothing (moving averages &c) function to yade.eudoxos     5. Omega().run(num#,wait=False): if the bool is True, it is equivalent to o.run(20); o.wait() for convenience
      1. Fix file generator to properly return bool. This fixes some of default-test.py. Change python interface to throw on generator error rather than return bool.     2. Added python glue to set logging levels for individual loggers (from yade import log; log.setLevel('TriaxialTest',log.DEBUG) )     3. Configuration file for logging is not monitored anymore, since changes from python would be lost     4. Added PhysicalParameters BrefcomPhysParams to prepare for storing volumetric strain; adapted utils.sphere and utils.box to take physParamsClass argument to determine what class to actually create (was always BodyMacroParameters, which is the default now)     5. Brefcom now computes unbalanced force (which is apparently broken as far as the numbers go) and volumetric strain. Many cleanups in Brefcom as well.     6. The collider now properly deletes interactions !I->isReal && !I->isNew && haveDistantTransient. More discussion is needed on that, though.
      1. Fix USCTGen so that it works within default-test.py     2. Minor fixes as usual.
      1. Fix all crashing preprocessors - for the price of SDECLinkedSpheres and ThreePointBending not really working - InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGoemetry only handles SpheresContactGeometry (and not SDECLinkGeometry), OTOH CohesiveContactLaw works only on SDECLinkGeometry. scripts/default-test.py passes now all preprocessors.     2. SDECLinkGeometry marked as deprecated.
      1. Permit non-zero integeres as bool - sometimes the serializaer confuses bool with int; give warning to console about that.     2. the -opt profile (and optimize=1) generates instruction set for the current machine (gcc: -march=native) which means that the code may not run on different processor (e.g. core2 code will not run on Pentium IV). Please let me know if this is problem for someone.
      1. Fix error with newer ipython coming from the fact that sys.argv wasn't defined in the embedded python env.     2. Fixes in brefcom.     3. stopSimulationLoop in TriaxialCompressionEngine if we enter LIMBO state.
      1. Fix refresh period: use it for regular GL rendering as well     2. Make "open automatically" open generated simulation even if a simulation is already loaded     3. Fix crasher (on some machines) the close() was emitted 2× for QtFileGenerato
      1. Fix a typo causing crash in the renderer.
      Fix another crash - rendering interaction that were, meanwhile, deleted during simulation being loaded. A more proper solution (like having a mutex on the whole rootBody that would be locked during loading) is welcome.
      1. Remove draw mutex when loading simulation introduced a few days ago (may throw boost::lock_error under some conditions)     2. Restore default signal handlers before exit from main; set SEGV handler to nullHandler since on i386 we (on lenny consistently) get crashes in some log4cxx destructor.
      WARNING! This version crashes - but I don't know why and I please for help. Summary follows.
      1. Fix GUI "crash" when trying to run python console without terminal (running by clicking an icon, for example): if no $TERM, run non-interactively     2. Select QtGUI over PythonUI if no $TERM set
      1. Do not propagate exception to c++ (-> crash) if there is python exception in the script being run from command-line. Just print traceback and drop to the python console (unless stop after execution specified).
      1. Kill building threads if the master thread is interruped in multi-builds (profile=a,b)
      Fix physical action index.
      test commit (whitespace)
      test commit 2 (whitespace)
      test commit (whitespace)
      1. Fix catching all (including SystemExit) exceptions in python scripts. If nonInteractive or stopAfter, exit immediately, otherwise just print traceback and drop to the python shell. Reveals many unfunctional generators suddenly.
      1. Fix nan's in SpheresContactGeometry     2. Fix ThreePointBending returning false on success (?!)     3. Add Preprocessor().load() method to python wrapper that generates to tempfile and loads it immediately.
      1. Fix SDECLinkedSpheres returning false on succes (?!).

==================================================
yade-0.12.0rc1
Sun, Jul 27 10:52:50 2008 +0000

Bruno Chareyre (69):
      Modifications in the equations of "non-viscous" damping. The equations     are now as defined by Cundall.
      Engines are now compiled in a different order, with DeusExMachinas compiled last.     The full DEM package has been compiled successfully after thuis change.
      <none>
      <none>
      IsotropicCompressionEngine removed from SVN.     TriaxialTest do the same thing (i.e. isot. compression) better, and do more.
      The damping equations are reverted to their original expressions, with independant     damping of each DOF. It looks like the convergence to equilibrium is faster with     these equations.
      Squared distances are now compared instead of simple distances (faster) to     decide if two grains are in contact.     In addition, InteractionDetectionFactor is added as member data.     The default value is 1, a value greater than one will allow the geometry     of contacts to be created as soon as the distance is less than     Factor*SumOfRadii. Usefull for interactions at longer distances     (like capillary effects).
      A simple definition of contact stiffness based on E and nu :     kn = E*size of sphere (so that apparent stiffness will be independent of size)     ks = nu*kn
      A lot of small changes in triaxial classes, impossible to comment all of them;     but note that :     - TriaxialCompressionEngine can compress a sample to a dense isotropic state (either     by moving walls or increasing the size of the spheres),     - then change the confining pressure if needed (for running tests with different confining     pressure on the same sample),     - then start a triaxial compression test at constant zz strain rate and constant     xx and yy stress (when the sample is considered stable based on StabilityCriterion).     - The transitions between the different phases are (in principle) very smooth.
      Revert erroneous (and unexpected) changes in this pro file.
      Minor changes in the computation of the critical timestep.
      All files related to capillary law.
      Update of all classes related to dry and unsaturated triaxial tests.
      Modified definition of the interpenetration for box-spheres     interractions. The previous definition was inconsistent.
      Correction of a wrong formula introduced in the last revision     (the position     of the contact point was wrong).
      Some changes in the computation of critical timestep so that the     triaxial samples do not explode when dt is set to the automatic     value. The change mostly affects the first steps of a simulation. Now,     dt is computed at each timestep during the first steps, whatever the     value of the user-defined variable "timeStepUpdateInterval", until a     relevant value is found.
      Cosmetic changes in TriaxialTest.
      Initial zoom in the simulation player is set to a more reasonable value.
      UnbalancedForce member data was not defined in the constructor of TriaxialCompressionEngine, it was causing a crash when loading a     TriaxialTest.xml.
      -TriaxialTest now includes a recorder to write stress history to a file.     -safety factor is set to a smaller value in the timestepper as the     computed value was still a bit too large in some cases.     -UnbalancedForce is defined in TriaxialCompressionEngine() to avoid     errors when loading a xml.
      Link TriaxialTest with WallStressRecorder in SConscript
      This commit contains new classes in order to simulate cohesive     interactions with transient interactions.     The new SAPCollider does set IsReal=false at each time step, neither do     the Sphere2Sphere4Distant... engine. The user must set isReal=false in     another engine (here the CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw engine) in order     to have the interactions removed from the DistantPersistentSAPCollider     list.     All new engines are used in the CohesiveTriaxialTest.
      A REGISTER_ATTRIBUTE was missing in the previous commit.
      Some new classes related to the coupling with comsol (main author Andrea     Cortis).
      FIXED : TriaxialCompressionEngine was stopping the simulation at each     time step...
      1- New contact law and related classes : CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw. It will be the most general contac law in Yade soon     probably (TODO : include rotational effects like MomentRotation law).     2- New Stress-Strain recorder : TriaxialStateRecorder, autodetect the TrixialCompressionEngine of a MetaBody and write the     parameters from it in a text file.     3- TriaxialCompressionEngine and TriaxialStressController are modified in order to compute stress and strain on demand.
      Modification in the usage of default values in     GlobalStiffnessTimestepper.     Change in dt default values in the preprocessors.
      Added some comments (doxygen friendly)  and corrected the author in some of the source files related to the triaxial test example.
      In Yade.cpp : conditional compilation in order to compile with boost     1.33     In TriaxialTest.cpp : instanciation of a SimpleElasticRelationship     object before adding it to engines (to avoid a crash). Vaçlav please,     what is going on here?O
      Few "cerr" are back...
      Different fixes, including
      -TimeStepper : previousDt is now a registerable parameter, which can be used after saving/loading. New feature implemented : dt can be     increased at a steady rate : dt=1.5*dt each time maximum (to prevent sudden increases and explosions). Comments added.     -TriaxialTest : The timestepper is moved to a earlier location in the list of engines, so that the timestep is set before the     stressController call. REMARK : REGISTERABLE dt IN THE TIMESTEPPER MAY BE REDUNDANT WITH THE "RECOVER TIME STEP" FEATURE OF YADE, DO WE     NEED THIS ONE?     -StressController : revert a small mistake in last commit.
      Fix the bug with BrefCom in GlobalStiffnessCounter.
      Samll optimizations. r1263 is +25% slower than r1264 based on tests on 2 different computers.
      Added NewtonsDampedLaw :
      The test on penetrationDepth is moved to a different line : no need for a "new SpheresContactGeometry()" when     interaction->isReal will be false.
      A registered parameter (finalMaxMultiplier) was not set for the     relevant engine. Fixed now.
      Parameters are adapted to the last modifications in     TriaxialStressCompressionEngine.
      TriaxialStateRecorder : add the unbalanced force in 8th column.     TriaxialTest : revert order of creation of spheres and boxes (boxes first), to prevent numbering problems in SAPcollider when using     HydraulicTest.     HydraulicTest : search engines and modify their parameters (desactivate stress control/activate gravity)     dem/SConscript : link HydraulicTest with few more libs
      Safety coefficient on critical dt is changed to 1 (was 0.25 before).     0.25 was far too conservative.
      A bit (lot) of cleaning in TriaxialTest.     Useless recorders inherited from the early ages of Yade are no longer     present.
      Fixed interpolation for the case P=0.
      Added minimalist documentation.
      1. TriaxialCompressionEngine is now saving at the end of compaction rather than at the begining of compression test, so that the     simulation is saved when autoCompression is not activated (before this change, the simulation was going in LIMBO state without even     saving, which means it was lost).
      Some cleaning.
      A link was missing between TriaxialTest and the NewtonsDampedLaw (new engine doing the same as the 6 previous integrating engines).
      A lot of fixes to make this engine work correctly regarding transitions between different states, including situations     with saving/editing/loading.
      This commit contains an experimental version of the collider based on the triangulation package of CGAL.org.     Compilation is disabled for the moment, but uncommenting few lines will enable compilation if CGAL and my (me=Bruno) own libs are     available for linker.
      Contact law based on voronoi tesselation (using CGAL).     Not included in compiling process now, this is for JF Jerier.
      This reverts a previous change in IGMetaEngine from Janek (interactions were set "new" when not real - problem was that     non-distant interactions are ALWAYS "not real" when starting IG dispatching - so they were set new and reseted at     each timestep, which disabled friction).     What was supposed to be done in IGMetaengine is now replaced by something almost equivalent in the SAPcollider (the     difference is that if an interaction is not real before being reseted by the collider, it really means that it is     not-overlaping and not-physicaly-interacting).
      Again few changes in the behaviour of this engine, it should now handle correctly any manual change in the xml file     (still needs a fix : there is still a part of the code that is done only at first iteration, which means that a     modification of sigma_iso by editing the xml will give a different result than the same modification from PythonUI).
      Timestep safety coefficient is back to 0.25.
      - ks is registered in ElasticContactInteraction (it was not, which was a bug, but it was not     affecting computation because initialKs was used to set ks=initialKs at each timestep).
      Added code for computing porosity in TriaxialStateRecorder and titles for colums in output history file (porosity is     in the 9th column).
      1+2 : added "Key" string in filenames.     3 : missed that hpp in previous commit.
      A small cast mistake.
      Corrected a local #include path.
      Added a function that can modify friction of all bodies/interactions.     Usefull to compact at low friction and then perform the compression test with normal (higher) friction.
      Modify slightly the way shear displacement is computed to prevent "ratcheting" (see comment)
      Same modif as in ElasticContactLaw (previous revision) to prevent "ratcheting".
      Added a code that will be common to all output filenames to help sorting different simulation results.
      Some code for triangulation/tesselation using CGAL, it is experimental and not included in the build process for the moment.
      Fixed a bug due to a wrong macro definition in CGAL (CGAL_LIB_CREATE sould be "ar cr" instead of "ar cr ''").     This macro is not used now.
      - epsilonMax added to compressionEngine to stop simulation.     - data files for Triangulation removed from svn     - bool "isNeighbor" added to interactions, used in     triangulationCollider.
      - Modified numerical scheme to reproduce a standard 2nd order finite     difference scheme integration (more stable).     - TimeStepSafetyCoefficient can be set to 1 rather than 0.25.     - same change still to be done in the separate LeapFrog engines (the     default TimeStepSafetyCoefficient is 0.25 in the meantime to prevent     explosions with preprocessors using those separate engines).
      NewtonsDampedLaw : fixing a small mistake and cleaning the code.     IMPORTANT NOTE : Forces/Moments are not affected by damping now, only     accelerations are modified. The result is the same in terms of damping, but users can now     get the exact values of forces/moments on bodies at any point during a     timestep.
      Mostly small changes and fixes from previous weeks. Sorry for such poor comments...
      ks is added to registered parameters.
      Fix a problem resulting in VectSet (default)  and HashMap being used     simultaneously for transient/persistent interactions     in the same simulation (which for unknown reasons is not     good).

Janek Kozicki (82):
      added info where are the pictures for the user manual
      can be undeleted from the history if anybody needs that
      directories for Czesiu and Tiziano to work on yade packages: debian and gentoo. later we can add directories for .rpm, etc....
      - better DynLib error reporting     - new Lattice, only 2D     - triaxial test from Bruno     - deleted unused QGLThread
      Fixed some problems with yade-flat
      deleted yade-lib-time, and using boost::posix_time instead
      - it is possible to select (shift click) and 'm'ove bodies in the simulation view window.       a dirty implementation. Needs major refactoring.     - the "display" tab now offers the ability to set 'display refresh rate' in [ms]       so it's like the priority of draw.
      renaming     SimulationRunner -> ThreadRunner     SimulationFlow -> ThreadWorker
      renaming done.
      FileGenerator now does not block whole GUI when generating. And can be stopped     if function generate() calls somewhere in the loops:
      small fixes to ThreadWorker
      Graphics display can be now synchronized with the calculation without problems,     and without blocking GUI
      - more improvements in ThreadRunner, ThreadWorker::~ThreadWorker and SimulationController      - fiddling with lattice: angle between beams is now calculated in 3D not 2D, with tracking of positive/negative angle.        So the angle is between -180 and 180 deg, while arcus cosinus can only give a result between 0 and 180 degrees.
      Finally deleted swiftpp and qhull. Now we have less license problems. There is     still license problem with math library, though.
      ...
      ...
      Some cleaning, involving changing variable names, like     Body::interactingGeometry. Which caused almost all the files to be modified.
      oops, forgot to commit MyTetrahedronLaw
      renaming: ElasticContactParameters ElasticContactInteraction
      renaming cd...
      renaming finished: ElasticContactParameters ElasticContactInteraction
      added GLDrawStateFunctor. So now it is possible to see bodies' velocity,     acceleration, angularVelocity, angularAcceleration. And other State attributes     of a body.
      =========-----------------============
      --------------------------------------     NullGUI allows to call a FileGenerator
      Omega throws when loading bad simulation file
      -----------     SimulationController catches that error from Omega :)     (when loading bad file)
      'C' key centers scene on selected body     'D' sets the 'isDynamic' flag of selected body. (select it twice to unset this flag).
      --     flag that allows to enable/disable calculating of torsion     LatticeExample FileGenerator can now generate a 3D tetrahedral regular grid. (before there was only orthogonal grid)
      Added drawMask to OpenGLRenderingEngine, it is now possible to see only bodies that have a certain groupMask
      Added non-working scripts that can compile yade using waf. At least they are not working for me.
      --     removed invMass and invInertia. Removed special handling for division by zero.     mass shouldn't be zero anyway.
      Matrix3 patch from Vaclav
      - FileGenerator reports how long the generation took     - yade.cpp takes PREFIX and POSTFIX as #define /some/path , without "     - small change to lattice generation method     - Makefile cleans after scons     - SConstruct:        removed \" from defines in PREFIX and POSTFIX line 147        added -pthread for g++ 3.3        moved env.Append(CXXFLAGS=['-pipe','-Wall','-pthread']) before invoking the tests        changed "nor" to "not", line 271        removed PATH, becuase I couldn't get it to work. so instead I set CXX='distcc g++-3.3'
      - FileGenerator shows generation time, and saving time
      - QtFileGenerator remembers save file name (so it is not always       ../data/scene.xml), this was done in previous commit. A small bugfix here
      - OpenGLRenderingEngine didn't draw Body when it's groupMask was 0     - some changes in lattice.
      - I added GeometricalModelForceColorizer. It is another hacky Engine that I       have added (along with Quadrilaterals). I did it, because I wanted to see       spheres colored according to force acting on them. This is a hack because the       GLDraw mechanism is currently very limited, and has to be extended to allow       things like this. So currently it works, but not in a way it should be done.       GLDraw* changes are coming ... soon :)
      In this commit I made Interactions drawable by GLDraw*, and I added three     example GLDraws for Interactions:
      - in GLViewer new keys: 'o' and 'p' to change the field of view. Useful for changing the perspective.
      IMPORTANT: In this sommit I have added a third parameter to          GLDrawInteractingGeometryFunctor, which means that all GLDrawInteracting*          classes had to be changed. If you have your own classes that draw interacting          geometry you must modify them as well. The extra paramater added is 'bool          wireFrame'. I think it will be useful :)
      - a more prominent warning when PREFIX was not defined during compilation     - ThreePointBending does not crash when there is not file to load     - some fiddling with lattice
      moved some obsolete scripts to doc/removed
      - Updated trunk/ChangeLog       - new icon
      - fix several warnings,     - merge latest version of lattice from my PhD     - todo: serialization problems with findType in NodeRecorder and FEMBeam, remove ErrorTolerant, fix collistions in rigid body
      - removed ErrorTolerant,      - SConscript uses md5sum instead of timestamp.
      Tetrahedron modification to std::vector
      - fixed crash in SDECLinkedSpheres example - there must me a dynamic cast in       InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry.cpp       until the containers are rewritten.     - fixed RotatingBox and BoxStack examples - and accidental mistake in SAPCollider
      - timestepper is set correctly when loading file in GUI (I hope!) - no need to reload second time     - FileGenerator does not open SimulationController if it already exists
      - introduced body_id_t(ype) so that bodies are not numbered as an int, but as a body_id_t     - added center 'scene button' on first tab of simulation controller
      trunk on SVN is deprecated now
      undeprecating trunk. Now I'll apply diffs from BZR back here.
      BZR revno: 983     committer: vsmilauer <vsmilauer@c1sinquatis-l>       Fix scons to handle boost.*-mt well, some other cleanups.
      BZR revno: 989     committer: VĂĄclav Ĺ milauer <eudoxos@arcig.cz>     message:       Modify debian builds so that making source packages for release versions work as well.
      BZR revno: 991     committer: Janek Kozicki <cosurgi@berlios.de>     message:       - Tetra2TetraBang returns before it starts (to avoid crashes in the release)       - fixed some crashing of HangingCloth, but I see that there is still some         problem. Tracking it down is a waste of time, currently, because new         containers will enforce refactoring here and fixing this problem.       - FileGenerators try to set the timestep when TimeStepper is not used. But it         is still not working when simulation is running during the generation. This         means, that 'dt' should not be in Omega, but inside a simulation itself. At         last there is a clear answer for this dilemma.
      OK, I think that migration back from BZR is complete :-)
      Ooops, previous commit did break SCDECLinkedSpheres example and HangingCloth...     I hope that it's fixed now. Also removed warnings from Capillary law... again.
      HangingCloth finally is fixed, and is not crashing in optimized build. The     dynamic cast ought to be in HangingCloth.cpp FileGenerator ;)
      Added RELEASE file in tags/yade-0.11.0     more descriptive error message when directory ../data/ doesn't exist     (usually happens at start...)
      - update yade icon, by Vaclav's suggestion (the red spheres are not so vividly red, so looks a bit better)     - scons will create the installation directory if it doesn't exist     - incorporated Bruno's fixes into 0.11 release
      - Updated RELEASE info in yade.cpp, although the best would be if sons will #define RELEASE
      update changelog
      Preparinf 0.11.1 release. Updated INSTALL file. ForceRecorder now checks if a body exists.
      changed char* yadePluginClasses[]= to const char* yadePluginClasses[]= to eliminate possible misuse     updated release 0.11.1 looks like ready to ship
      Some fixes in lattice regarding yade::serialization problems (function findType()) that started to occur when using g++ newer than 3.4     The offending code was commented because it wasn't working. Now I uncommented and modified it, so it works.
      deleted unused class AAInteractingBox2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures
      Use lattice model for simulation of concrete with steel fibres reinforcement.
      SConstruct is now working on debian etch,     exclude multimethods in Doxyfile
      1. Fix FUNCTOR2D mistake in CundallNonViscousMomentumDamping     2. make it compile with python2.4 and qt3 (which sucks)     NOTE: python-scientific requires boost 1.34
      recent changes in Dispatcher seemingly broke adding InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4DistantSpheresContactGeometry and InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry as strings. Need to create class instance first, then add it as a variable (not as string).
      I must assign something to avoid "nan" when loading dt. When recover=false, those can be "nan" and lead to crash.
      - draw linked interactions only if isReal.
      Added StaticAttractionEngine, which help to fasten a little the initial stage     of compression - removing the central void. But it is in fact too slow, for     bigger usage. That's because everything is attracted to everything.
      I don't know what's up with Brefcom, but I need yade to compile, because those guys who will sell us 16-core machine will be using this SVN revision for their benchmarks.
      dang! I just want the latest SVN revision to compile.
      yade.cpp give info about cmdGui      -N name : specify the user interface (available: NullGUI, cmdGui, QtGUI)      FileGenerator catches exceptions.
      Moment law.
      1. moment law: some cleaning     2. GLDrawSphere - draws circles faster (wireframe)     3. yadeControl - fix compilation error with optimized builds: YADE_PTR_CAST -> dynamic_pointer_cast
      in previous commit, when optimizing the circle, I committed by accident a filled version. It's just a bool to toggle between filled and not filled, but, it's not possible to change from GUI... yet.
      Use / * - + for front cutting plane:     1. added new class YadeCamera : public qglviewer::Camera     2. ovverride virtual function which calculates the front cutting plane     3. it's possible that GLViewer4 will have to be modified - to use YadeCamera to        have this new feature - front cutting plane. I didn't touch it.
      Ask the FileGenerator for the filename.
      - flag 'active' in DisplacementEngine     - CapillaryCohesiveLaw now complains to stderr (could use LOG_WARN as well, but didn't compile)     - flag 'always_use_moment_law' in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw (so is possible to use even for broken contacts)     - added comment about the contact law from PFC-3D (I used it for comparison with Wenjie)
      - started snow creep test.     - added optional creep in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw

Jerome Duriez (1):
      - A new Preprocessor (DirectShearCis) allowing to simulate ... direct shear tests with the Engine associated to let move correctly the box (CinemCisEngine)

Sergei Dorofeenko (17):
      Add linear viscoelastic contact model
      1. Main commit: import a geometry of walls from a STL file.
      Translate comments to english.
      1. Fix orientation. Now one can rotate the STL geometry.     2. Added rotation kinematics to STLImporterTest preprocessor     3. Bugs fix.     4. Added another example of STL file in examples directory.
      1. Python wrapper for STLImporter     2. Example python preprocessor STLImporterTest.py     3. Small fixes
      1. Added attribute zeroPoint to RigidBodyParameters and RotationEngine. This attribute defines the rotation center of kinematic body.     2. For ElasticContactLaw added accounting rotation of kinematic body around its zeroPoint.     3. Added phase flag "cycle" to Interaction. SpatialQuickSortCollider is modified so interaction's cycle flag is used to mark stale contacts instead isReal flag.     4. Small changed InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry and GLDrawElasticContactInteraction. I think, towards an improvement. If there are objections, changes must be reverted.     5. pyOmega.save allows recovery     6. STLImporter allows multiple files to import consistently.     7. Bugs fix.
      reverting condition c->isReal
      1. Add engine ResetPositionEngine for the return of bodies at their initilal positions.     2. small fixes.
      Small fixes
      Fix relative path in SimulationPlayer
      small fix
      1. ResetPositionEngine: added import/export initial positions from file     2. GLSimulationPlayerViewer: skip bodies which does not have a geometrical model     3. QtGeneratedSimulationPlayer: small fixes layout and sizePolicy.     4. utils.py: agreement spheresToFile and spheresFromFile
      In PositionOrientationRecorder and GLSimulationPlayerViewer pass the bodies without geometrical model     Small fixes in PositionOrientationRecorder
      1. Added new engines:     - FiltrEngine is a base engine for a scene filtration before     visualization (both for a player and for a controller). The filtration is     activated through GUI (now only for SimulationPlayer).     - ColorizedLayerFilter  allocates with colour a layer of bodies     - ColorizedVelocityFilter  allocates with colour a velocity of bodies     2. Add Omega::setCurrentIteration to allow current simulation time from a player     3. ResetPositionEngine allows onlyDynamic (without save subscribed bodies ids)
      small fixes
      fix errors in previous commits
      Fix in SimulationPlayer: search filters and updateGL after loading simulation

Unknown (2):
      Fixed some typos.
      Modified Doxyfile not to show lib/ and to optimize for C++

Václav Šmilauer (208):
      Multiple changes.
      Add logging.hpp which I forgot in the previous commit.
      Remove printing headers being linked, add help for cleaning. Tried scons on a cleanly checked-out trunk and it worked. Sorry for the traffic.
      1. Two sets of files were named StiffnessMatrixTimeStepper, of which the other one was in directory Global StiffnessTimestepper. Since it was not used (not compiled by default), I renamed the second set to match the directory name. If it breaks something, let me know.     2. Updated the scons script, scons now compiles yade completely, including header installation. It is yet to be tuned to be lot more fast, but works fine already.     3. Cleaning up messages at startup, (almost) everything is piped through the LOG_* stuff.     4. Included sample logging.conf.sample file, log4cxx is amazingly flexible and easy to use. Give it a try!     5. Lot of debugging since after the last change of allowing regular files to be plugin-loaded, yade would try to load garbage (like the file foobar.baz transformed to libbar.so and the like) giving spurious errors. Everything should work properly now, you can have whatever you like in the plugins directories. It will not even crash on short files (amazing fragility...).     6. Removed the message from ResultantForceEngine constructor, to not to pollute the console every time. Dtto for StiffnessMatrixTimeStepper.     7. Added one ; in yade.cpp that broke compilation without LOG4CXX. The non-log4cxx macros are now enclosed within {} just as their log4cxx counter parts. This should eliminate the need for separately building both configurations.
      First commit from the wm3 convergence set. Header files were modified to allow compilation with old methods with deprecation warnings from the compiler.
      This is the second changeset. Yade now compiles without any single warning about deprecated functions. For fixing your own code, I will upload a script to automatize that process shortly. As time goes by, deprecated functions and (slowly) wm3 itself will be removed from yade's sources.
      Provided script hackett-warn-replace.py is for eventually helping you with replacing deprecated wm3 methods by the good ones.     hackett.py was used to insert deprecated wrapper to headers and will probably never used as such anymore. Deleted old erskine2* stuff, since it is superseded by erskine3* and scons.
      This commit marks properly all headers as well as methods that were deprecated during the transition to the official wm3 library. Next commit will follow shortly and will fix all deprecated headers warnings. It is (and will be for a while) to compile in with USE_BASTARDIZED_WM3 to use the old headers, but expect many warnings during the build.
      - Bastardized wm3 library ejected from the tree. From now on, you need to install wm3 separately. Will update README shortly on how to proceed. Basically, add  "-I/usr/local/include/wm3" to CXXFLAGS if you use qmake. Includes and linking was adjusted in c++ and .pro files.     - DOUBLE_PRECISION removed in favor of SINGLE_PRECISION. Therefore, the default is to define Reals as doubles now. SINGLE_PRECISION will be removed very soon anyway.     - Removed yade-lib-algorithms, since it is not used. Once someone needs it, it can be found in svn history.     - Created yade-lib-base, that for now contains      1. Logging.hpp: moved from yade-core to avoid circular dependency),      2. yadeWm3.hpp: typedefs for Vector3r Vecrtor3<Real>, definition of Real. This header will be removed soon, since it will not be needed.      3. yadeWm3Extra.hpp: things that were added to the bastardized wm3, like a few operators and functions. You almost certainly want to include it in your code if you get undefined references (and link with yade-lib-base).     - Omega now reports undefined symbols demangled.
      Re-enable workaround for scons: create install directories beforehand. Cause of that is to be inspected yet.
      Disable DEBUG messages for non-log4cxx builds so that Janek's screen is nicer ;-) (sorry for these scattered commits, hopefully this is the last one).
      Exceptions from the FileGenerator thread are now properly caught; it means for example that if you pass an invalid classname in createActors, yade will tell yo     +u what class it wasn't able to construct instead of hanging infinitely.
      Massive update of scons, which I now recommend for building. It has some autodetection support as well.     Please report any bugs (?) / RFEs to me. Brief instruction are given in INSTALL.
      Quick fix for recently discovered segfault. Wondering why it didn't surface before. Valgrind still complains about PhysicalActionVectorVectorIterator::increment using an unitialized value, but that may be unrelated (probably is) to this one.
      SCons update, please use it and report any problems to yade-dev or yade-users. Thanks.
      Iterations/sec display added to simulation controller (someone more sensible may redesign the layout in the future). Line ending changed from CRLF to CR.
      Scons accepts additional POSTFIX parameter, which will alter installation so that PREFIX/{bin,lib}/yade becomes PREFIX/{bin,lib}/yadePOSTFIX (similar to EXTRAVERSION of Linux). Further, configuration files will be searched for in ~/.yadePOSTFIX instead of ~/.yade. Unfortunately, headers installed in PREFIX will still be overwritten by newer version, even with different POSTFIX, since most files do something like #include<...>. This is meant to ease simultaneous installations of different variants of yade. To achieve full independence, PREFIX and POSTFIX should be different. Note that you don't need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since scons uses linker's -rpath option (hint: man ld). If someone has better solution, please let me know.
      Microchange to comment on naming of scons configuration options.
      SConscruct file update - make it work with older scons, remove -floop-optimize2 that doesn't exist for older gcc (<4.0).
      Hunted down the bugwith node enumeration, now should be reliable. Added some checks so that configuration is not done when cleaning, likewise for installable nodes (so we do NOT uninstall upon cleaning). If you use g++-3.3, you need to set e.g. CXX="distcc g++-3.3 -pthread". This will be fixed perhaps in the future but for now the default is to keep it simple.
      Other fix for sarge (0.96.1) version of scons. It is a variant to be removed. For some features (especially the srcdir keyword), sonner or later we will mandate 0.96.94 to build yade, but that can be a few months in the future, though.
      Fix node enumeration for newer scons's (isfile() is true only if the file already exists, which is contrary to what I thought).
      Microchanges: fix rpath quoting, fix ctags indexing non-c++ files (local bug? --language=c++ would make all files (including .o, for example), being indexed.
      Plugin loader now handles multi-class plugins, provided that they define "char* yadePluginClasses[]" symbol containing list of class names (sentinel=NULL) that the plugin contains. Regular one-class-per-file plugins work normally.
      Fix build process for older versions of scons that break if there is a target that has no sources. Added a dummy empty file to the loki library to do that, modified project file. Do not forget to delete yade-libs/yade-lib-loki before running scons again to regenerate SConscript files.
      1. Include IsotropicCompressionTest in dem's preprocessors project so that it gets compiled     2. Improve erskine to indent SConscripts in a nice way
      1. Fixed Omega::scanPlugins so that it loads plugins that were linked without -rpath for their dependencies. Everything is in #ifdef STUPID_DLL     2. Removed again IsotropicCompressionTest since needed headers are missing. Bruno, please add them back (they were removed in the 1045 commit.) and then enable IsotropicCompressionTest in yade-packages/yade-package-dem/src/PreProcessor/PreProcessor.pro again.
      Default preferences.xml doesn't neglect the last plugin dir (off-by-one error)
      Simulation may be (which is the default) loaded after generation automatically now.
      Prepare framework for "high-level clumps". Everything is withing #ifdef HIGHLEVEL_CLUMPS, hence shouldn't change anything unless compiled with that option (don't try at the moment, it doesn't work). More information at http://beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/phd/index.cgi/YaDe/HighLevelClumps .
      1. provide Doxyfile, running "cd yade-doc; doxygen" will produce html reference documentation     2. initial (non-functional) implementation of high-level clumps, along with some cleanup of the changes done elsewhere     3. erskine now can be given scons variables (namely, $PREFIX) that will be unexpanded in generated SConscript's     4. SConscruct #defines HIGHLEVEL_CLUMPS, since other people probably don't use scons (yet)     5. New method Body::byId, new typedef Body::id_t, new constant Body::ID_NONE (jailed in HIGHLEVEL_CLUMPS for now, that will be removed sooner or later)
      1. Clump code completed, but totally untested so far.     2. Added target 'doc' to Makefile that runs doxygen     3. New tracing macro TRWM3QUAT for quaternions
      1. Clump::subBodies are now a std::map<Body::id_t,Se3r>, subSe3s removed.     2. Sample clump generator ClumpTestGen written; works, but yade crashes because of dispatchers being setup incorrectly.     3. Omega::setRootBody added so that rootBody can be temporarily set during filegeneration, which is necessary for Body::byId.
      1. Fixes in the clump code     2. InteractionGeometryMetaEngine doesn't crash if a body doesn't have interactingGeometry (like Clump)     3. Fixes in the collider, related to the clump code     4. ClumpSubBodyMover is now a DeuxExMachina     5. discovered bug in Wm3::Matrix3::EigenDecomposition     6. ClumpTestGen generates a usable testcase (either a random one, or with one-sphere clump and an equivalent sphere) for testing purposes. Parameters etc. are physically wrong, but at least there are no crashes.     7. ClumpTestGen temporarily sets rootBody in Omega so that Body::byId is usable
      1. Clump code is not (hopefully) correct physically - translational, rotational and potential energies give constant sum over time (more or less)     2. ClumpTestGen generates a useful scenario of standalone sphere, {1,2,3,4}-sphere clump.     3. Inertia calculation fallback for cases with NaNs from EigenDecomposition.     4. acceleration and angularAcceleration reset after every position update for clump.     5. Body::{isClump,isClumpMember,isStandalone} added.     6. Gravity engine skips clump members (applied to the whole clump only).
      1. Clump code cleanup     2. Python may now be embedded in yade: (i) SConscruct checks for it and #defines EMBED_PYTHON if present. (ii) main sets up the interpreter. One disadvantage is that Python runs in its own thread, so pressing ^C during simulation doesn't quit yade (^\ still works).     3. New class PythonRecorder that evaluates arbitrary expression when activated.     4. Pyade interface that makes it possible to retrieve some values from yade in Python. For example, you can now record body #5 z-velocity and z-angularVelocity every 10 iterations by setting PythonRecorder::expression="if (S.i%10==0): print B[5].v[2],B[5].w[2]". Retrievable attributes are documented in the source (or the Doxygen documentation).
      1. selection in the renderer are now saved in Omega::selectedBodies (GUI to that list is in the future yet)     2. PythonRecorder now supports retrieving selected bodies; it redirects stdout to file if specified.     3. pyade now required scientific python to be installed - this permits to do vector and quaternion arithmetics in python. General cleanup.     4. pyadeDummy.py module added - for testing pyade without yade
      Microchange to catch exception from distutils in python detection.
      1. Scons changes, node enumeration gotten rid of, now uses proper Install in SConscript's. Should eliminate scons version problems we've had.     2. Some new make targets: for repetitive compilation (with -j2) and first personalizaed target: eudoxos.     3. Selecting clump member in GLViewer now selects the whole clump; it is moved and redrawn as well (only with HIGHLEVEL_CLUMPS).     4. An attempts at escaping special characters beforce XML serialization (\",\n,\t,\\), doesn't work - commented out.     5. Project files cleaned from nonexistent include directories.
      1. OK, the floats floating around for colors drove me nuts, so I replace all of that garbage by doubles. Since for one particular case (glMaterialv) the corresponding function taking double (glMaterialdv) is not defined in mesa (and perhaps not in most other gl libs), for that one the argument was converted explicitly.     2. New Shop class, that defines static methods for easy things, along with a dictionary of default parameters for some useful stuff: like getting a rootbody with reasonable set of actors, sphere body, box body. That's all for the moment. Add your own stuff. Filegenerators may shrink considerably this way.     3. Clump::subBodies renamed to Clump::members, Clump::moveSubBodies to Clump::moveMembers, ClumpSubBodyMover to ClumpMemberMover - to be consistent with Body::isClumpMember. Clump still not moved to DEM, that will wait till later - at the moment, QGLViewer depends on Clump (for moving clump when selected and moved with mouse).
      Many extensive changes:
      1. renamed Chagelog to ChangeLog, will be generated autmatically from svn chamgelog     2. removed waf script (wscript), not used     3. scons now installs everything with '-version-postfix' appended, like yade-svn1072-debug     4. scons builds different variants (version and postfix) in separate directories
      1. Clump member velocities are calculated in ClumpMemberMover. This may create problems since velocity will always be lagged by one iteration.     2. removed cyclic dependency of Clump and Shop.
      1. Debugging mode now #defines YADE_DEBUG in addition to DEBUG, which seems to be #undef'ed by some header. Lazy to trace down.     2. Removed #ifdef DEBUG messages from dynlib &co (now under #if 0); use LOG_TRACE if you need those messages     3. Signal handler now handles SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) and SIGABRT (failed assertions, among other) in debugging mode: gdb is run, attached to the current process and backtrace of all threads is printed.
      Python fixes:     1. load pyade.py from path given by PREFIX and POSTFIX (we really need to define that somewhere in a unified manner: not by using BOOST_PP_STRINGIZE everywhere! - config.hpp...?)     2. velocity and angularVelocity are vectors now (returned only the x component by mistake)
      Attempt to access interactions from Python, commeted out for the moment. May disappear later. Not used anywhere. Do not use.
      1. Cleanup of clump includes     2. Scons now puts buildDir include directory first so that it shadows eventually installed versions     3. jobs=x added to scons, like -j3, but is saved accross runs     4. Archive modifications (shuffling includes around) so that compiling with recent g++ (4.1) works - was preprocessor problem.
      Fixed error in yesterday's commit, should compile really fine with g++4.1 now.
      SCons cleanup. Now supports buildPrefix (defaults to '..') so that build is completely separate from sources.
      commit before mass-replacing Dymanic_cast. This will not compile, used only as wayback for me. New commit shortly.
      dynamic_cast replaced by YADE_CAST where appropriate: i.e. the result of the cast is not checked to verify whether the conversion was successful as condition for further flow branching. The consequence is that you have to #define YADE_CAST in CXXFLAGS by hand as either dynamic_cast (original version) or static_cast (for optimized builds) when using make.
      dynamic_pointer_cast replaced by YADE_PTR_CAST as appropriate. It must be defined on compiler command-line (-DYADE_PTR_CAST=dynamic_pointer_cast or -DYADE_PTR_CAST=static_pointer_cast). Scons builds get this automatically.
      Doxygen settings from yade-flat imported. New file tracking removed elements.
      Merged the scons-layout branch to trunk.
      1. PythonRecorder runs optimized byte-compiled expression, optionally translated to machine-code by psyco     2. Serialization lib now properly escapes and unescapes XML-unfriendly charcters (\n,\t,<,>,",\\)->(\\n,\\t,\[,\],\',\\\\)
      1. Remove cyclic plugin loading forever (undefined STUPID_DLL)     2. Tetrahedron has vector<Vector3r> v instead of Vector3r v1,v2,v3,v4; (fem will probably not compile because of this for now - will be fixed)     3. Added experimental tetra class & friends.
      ough... put actual data in. Next commit will rename files as they should be (stupid svn...).
      Renamed files.
      1. gdbCrashBatch moved to Omega (was emptry when a different thread thatn the main one crashed?!)     2. Shop generates tetrahedra properly now, including dispatchers     3. Tetrahedra rendering and linking fixed     4. Added an icon to the main window (not serious ;-) )     5. commented out STUPID_DLL overflowing loader     6. log4cxx has level set to INFO by default (was DEBUG, lot of garbage on screen)
      1. Some type fixes (signed vs. unsigned). The Body ID mess needs to be cleaned up!!!     2. More tetrahedron stuff; will not compile for now, though.     3. Icon update ;-)
      1. remove vector<Vector3r> from tetrahedra code, replace simply by Vector3r[4]     2. implement 4h-4h intersection peroperly, without relying on wm3. Compiles, not tested for correctness at all.
      Make compilation proper when python is not found (no errors, just disable what should be disabled).
      #define MINIWM3 when using miniWm3     don't exclude lattice with miniWm3 (lattice needs to be modified to not use undefined functions from full Wm3 in this case (Delaunay!)
      Adjust QTDIR to gentoo, too     Configure-time decision whether to link against QGLViewer or 3dviewer.
      use -mt variants of boost byt preference if both exist     useMiniWm3 by default
      1. Fix fedora/centos etc compilation (<includehint> in the .ui file mentioning nonexistent file)     2. Other scons cleanup
      1. Fix soname on shared libs (no soname at all; bug with "" in the name previously). Is it good for something?     2. Add 'features' option to scons, which can enable/disable python and log4cxx at compile-time (extensible)
      1. Correct 'all' value for features     2. Add a few signed/unsigned typecasts     3. Check clump code
      1. Fix uninitialized se3 in one-member clump handling     2. Fix syntax error in SConstruct introduced in previous commit.
      If RELEASE file exists, get yade version from there, instead of from svn.
      Remove wildmagic-dev from debian deps.
      fixed qt3 detection (used deprecated qapp.h header instead of qapplication.h).
      Adjust debian package generation back to svn.
      frontend cleanups, eperimental python console ui.
      Convenience functions for serialization - experimental.
      fix qualifiers in constructor of AttrAccess
      1. rename ThreadWorker::message() to ThreadWorker::getStatus, ThreadWorker::setMessage() to ThreadWorker::setStatus (and private ThreadWorker::m_message to m_status)     2. add public: std::string FileGenerator::message that holds exit value description     3. FileGenerator::generate returns now bool (if the generation was successful); description in ::message     4. Adapted all generators and UIs for the above changes (except NullGUI - is that needed?)
      Adjust other components for FileGenerator changes. Add wrapper for preprocessor in python.
      1. SCons will download new version of itself if older thatn 0.96.93 and will proxy all calls to it transparently (hopefully)     2. Revamped python wrappers, now all attributes are settable as dicionary entries in respective instances from python     3. added example of python script that generates and runs BoxStack     4. Do not #define DEBUG, since it is used in log4cxx (as log4cxx::Levels::DEBUG). YADE_DEBUG is used everywhere. If you ever get weird errors about that, #undef DEBUG after including qt3 headers.     5. Some code cleanups.
      Fix argv[0] for scons proxy.
      Don't warn on amd64 about limited type range in comparison.
      Initial .spec file for fedora 6
      spec file works on fedora 6 now
      1. Add screw example (this is really my personal one...)     2. Fix Shop::tetra (tetra interacting geometry still incorrect or incorrectly drawn... why???)     3. Remove python finalization, boost should take care of that.     4. Possibly fix plugin loader bug (first plugin after one with yadePluginClasses "inherits" them unless it has its own yadePluginClasses defined).
      Sync SConstruct with sid packages (lib for qglviewer is not in capitals there)
      1. Tetrahedron fixes (intersections are correct now, but interaction still wrong - crashes??!)     2. Fix scons to work with versions > .97 (no syntax errors; didn't try if it compiles
      1. Scons now updates itself to 0.97.0d20070918 (for testing purposes etc)     2. fix crash in ElasticContactLaw and ElasticCohesiveLaw if interaction is not SpheresContactGeometry and ElasticContactInteraction; this fixes tetrahedra interaction.     3. other tetrahedron fixes (still not fully functional yet)     4. mark attributes in class factory as __attribute__((unused)) to avoid warnings
      1. Correct typo in comment in SConstruct     2. Correct formulas for 4hedron inertia, testcase passes     3. Switch to fixed timestep when timestep is being changed by user in the qt3 ui
      1. Change default timestep to 1e-8, should prevent weidness onthe first run.     2. Fix cmdGui to handle gracefully reading/assigning nonexistent attributes (not crash, but caught exception)     3. Fix char* / const char * warnings from g++-4.2 in main() and OpenGLRenderingEngine.     4. Cleanup of triaxial test, added parameter noLateralConfinement (not yet used).
      1. Default scons to latest snapshot (should be a bit faster)     2. Don't autocreate plugin path entries for paths that are not installed     3. Turn TriaxialStressEngine into state machine, while preserving the possibility of changing some values by hand in .xml. (should be tested).     4. Exclude Loki:: from doxygen docs.
      1. Remove relicts of old Omega::logMessage &c     2. Remove duplicated Wm3 headers in core (is already in lib-yade-base)     3. Update python scripting (object.attribute is shorthand for object['attribute'] now)     4. Cleanups in triaxial, adding STATE_UNINITIALIZED
      1. BIG update of python wrappers - enagines can be created, added, modified from python now. Examples will be provided very soon.     2. fix plugin loader for multi-plugins: YADE_PLUGIN() macro should be used in all plugins, otherwise due to linking symbol overrides a multi-plugin will shadow classes in the plugin actually being loaded (better solution?!)     3. Add experimental BREakable Frictional COhesive Moment-blocking material (brefcom for short), not yet fully done.     4. PersistentSAPCollider now can be parametrized to permit distant contacts (is not the default, though), incorporating Bruno's changes in DistantPersistentSAPCollider     5. Uniaxial strain-controlled test (USCT), a quite simple implementation. Used primarily for brefcom testing now.     6. Fix SConstruct so that it is backward-compatible with python2.4
      1. Remove MetaEngine, inherit MetaDispatchingEngine directly     2. Fix unbalanced force reporting (thanks for complaining, Bruno)     3. EngineUnits now declare their types with FUNCTOR1D(.) or FUNCTOR2D(.,.) macros, dispatchers will ask for their types automagically. Old syntax still supported, once all engines have those types declared, it will be obsoleted and removed (like e->add("InteractingSphere","InteractingSphere","InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry"); Shop and USCTGen usethe new syntax now.     4. Brefcom law passes some rudimentary tests and appears to work (normal force and damage for now; we miss shear force and blocked rotations)     5. Brefcom contact can be drawn with opengl, damage signified by color.     6. Updated Python wrapper.
      1. Remove the old prototype for adding EngineUnits to dispatchers add(string,string,string)     2. All EngineUnits now have FUNCTOR1D(...) or FUNCTOR2D(...,...) in their headers.
      1. Preliminary recovery of simulation accross runs (try sending SIGHUP to yade)     2. Python wrapper for body parameters.     3. Misc fixes of engines.     4. Allow Omega to stop at predefined iteration number (for regression tests, I work on that ;-) )     5. ...
      Fix lefover of experimental code in TriaxialCompressionEngine (creating sohesive links after compaction.
      Updated brefcom, with undisclosable parts moved outside the tree.
      Fix typo breaking compilation on different machines than mine.
      1. Remove "../data", replace by "./" (cwd) or "".     2. Some other stuff I don't remember.
      1. HUGE update of python, it wraps almost all yade classes now (except PhysicalActionContainer and InteractionContainer). Documentation is lacking as well.     2. Move most of init stuff of python from cmdGui::run to cmdGuiInit.py (which I forgot to "svn add", will commit shortly)     3. Run ipython shell (or python shell with history and tab completion as fallback) inside yade
      Adding init code as advertised in last commit.
      Passing exclude='qt3' to scons will disable qt3 checks and everything related to qt3. Note that the default GUI is still QtGUI unless you change that in your config file or at command line with -N.
      Avoid using boost1.34 python/stl_iterator.hpp, should compile with 1.33 now (debian etch, ubuntu feisty)
      Fixes and addendum for openSuse based on comments by Sega
      1. Test suite for all preprocessors     2. Added assumeElasticSpheres attribute to GlobalStiffnessCounter; if set to false, dynamic_casts are used to properly determine type of contact between spheres (used in USCTGen now)     3. Debugger now dumps backtrace without interruption and exits immediately (core is still dumped)
      1. cmdGui now exports yade binary name (to allow spawning subprocesses)     2. default-test.py handles crashing simulations gracefully (by executing them in a subprocess)     3. Omega retains original argc and argv from the command line.
      1. Remove NaN's in PersistentSAPCollider for bodies that don't have bounding box: use zero-size degenerate box at its position instead. (fixes warning when running ClumpTestGen)     2. Remove check for scientific python from scons as we don't use it now.
      1. BIG: Moved latest upstream qglviewer to our tree. If you REALLY need to use the packaged version, let me know. As of now, there is no way to do that.     2. BIG: Removed many (unfunctional) parts of the qt3 GUI, in the view of qt4 migration which will probably not happen. Maybe I removed too much (simulation player -- does it work?!), let me know in that case.     3. Experimental GLViewer support in python, disabled. (broken and needs qt4)     4. Misc fixes related to that and other small stuff.
      Previous commit didn't compile on clean environment, fixed now.
      HOTFIX: final fix for the libqglviewer linking issue.... I hate qt3, I hate uic, I hate moc.     It works now, please test on you machines and let me know if there are any regressions.
      Forgotten files, build crashed on foreign machine. Fixed now. (This stuff is not tested, do not use!)
      OK, now QGLViewer REALLY builds. Was bug in scons: file.ext1.ext2 is not handled properly with the qt3 tool. Created symlinks replacing first dot with _.
      Add tags, doc and clean "targets" to scons do their job, short-circuit the rest of building process and exit. Clean only removes builddir, _not_ installed files as -c would do. (LP: #202067)
      1. Resurredced and un-crapped simulation player (for making videos). Updated howto is http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/New:Making_videos#Using_Simulation_Player_with_svn.3E1281
      1. Include fracture strain calibration routines in brefcom.     2. Add BrecomDamageColorizer - changes colora ccording to average cohesive interactions the body has.     3. Delete non-cohesive interactions from inside BrefcomLaw when spheres become distant.     4. Documentation updates.
      1. MAJOR improvements of the python wrappers (constructors take attributes etc.)     2. FIRST proof-of-implementation simulation completely created in python: scripts/simple-scene.py. This file will be commented abundantly shortly.     3. Add default values to some bool params so that there is no serializer error if they are uninitialized.     4. Add aabbEnlargeFactor to InteractingSphere2AABB (should be added to InteractingBox2AABB as well?) (not tested yet)     5. rename InteractionDetectionFactor to interactinDetectionFactor     6. Serialization now registers only attributes that have not yet been registered (there were problems with python because of that: at first save, attributes were duplicated and the xml file was less readble, although loadable)     7. Scan .tpp and .ipp for c++ tags as well     8. Some documentation.
      1. New engine attracting bodies towards a fixed axis (constant force, points towards the axis everywhere)     2. some fixes in python wrapper (run initializers if needed; the logic in yade itself is currently broken however)     3. New python "example" for creating cylindrical packing of spheres
      1. allow saving spheres (format like small.sdec.xyz) from python     2. PositionOrientationRecorder can optionally record RGB color of each body as well now     3. SimulationPlayer now can change colors of bodies, if the .rgb file exists     4. Bunch of fixes if brefcom, in UniaxialStrainControlledTest     5. dt moved from Omega to MetaBody for good; this allows preprocessor to set timestep that will be used when the simulation is loaded.     6. Code cleanups here and there.
      Update debian control to possibly fix deb package builds
      Fix header scanner if there are extra headers in the tree.
      1. PROTOTYPE CHANGE: Engine::action(Body*) changed to Engine::action(MetaBody*); all engines adapted     2. MetaBody::miscParams can be used to set static variables at deserialization (used for GLDrawBrefcomContact now)     3. allow serialization of shared_ptr<Serializable> (only pointers to derived classes were enabled until now)     4. big fixes inside brefcom     5. enhancements of python interface (Generic class, fixes)     6. added Shop::GLDrawLine, Shop::GLDrawArrow, Shop::GLDrawNum     7. fixed QGLViewer #defining DEBUG (qt3) by #undef'ing it after qt3 headers inclusion
      1. Add many checks to see where XML and BIN serializers take each other's work (non-intrusive).     2. reorganization of cmdGui (will be renamed - perhaps - to pyUi or similar)     3. BINFormatManager is now optional and _disabled by default_. feature 'binfmt' must be enabled to build the plugin.     4. Added utils classes in python, examples are much simplified now.
      Fix python2.4 compatibility
      fix of the previous fix.
      1. Commit before other changes.
      Renamed cmdGui to PythonUI. Tests seem to be working now.
      1. Define macro NEEDS_BEX() that engines can use to advertise what physical actions they need. This avoids the necessity of passing that to PhysicalActionContainerInitializer. The change is backwards-compatible, all present engines were adapted however.     2. Fix BrefcomTestGen and USCTGen: don't crash anymore.     3. Small fixes in python code.
      Svn wants to commit before moving files... :-|
      Refactored MetaDispatchingEngine to MetaEngine (everywhere)
      Support saving to .xml, .xml.gz and .xml.bz2. Loading works as well.
      1. Added heavy comments to simple-scene.py, started functionally equal code in extra/SimpleScene.{c,h}pp     2. Added dependency on boost::iostreams to debian template (for gzip/bzip2 streams).
      Hotfix for file loading logic.
      1. Ignore ^C in PythonUI (gives crashes)     2. Shop::Bex caches physical action indices in static variables (not yet benchmarked)     3. Check for boost/foreach.hpp in scons and suggest how to install it.     4. Fixes in Brefcom     5. Set initial qglview size to 550x550
      Big scons updates:
      Fix compilation problems and some warnings in the previous commit.
      1. BOOST_FOREACH now works with InteractionContainer and BodyContainer and is #defined as foreach.
      1. GUI change in qt3: make the simulation controller to take _much_ less space (no LCD displays, notably) and allow more place for 3d views. If someone is not happy with that, gui/qt3 can be reverted.     2. UniaxialStrainController now measures and records transversal strain.     3. Add attempt at smart command-line completion for ipython console.     4. Improved the class index cache in Shop::Bex (benchmarks needed)
      1. Added MetaBody* as optional argument to Body::byId, to avoid Omega::instance().getRootBody() lookups - took a few percent of time in valgrind-profiled run.     2. Completed SimpleScene, a script to generate commented source py2wiki.py and put results on http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/SimpleSceneTutorial     3. Swap argument order in utils.sphere and utils.box to match Shop::sphere and Shop::box (center first, then radius/extents and not vice versa as it used to be)
      Make the GUI loader/saver a bit less intelligent. .yade, .xml, .xml.gz, .xml.bz2 are accepted when both loading and saving (hopefully).
      1. Fix tabs in SConstruct.
      1. Rudimentary plotting support through python; see http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/PythonPlotting and scripts/simple-scene-graph.py for details     2. Updates in examples/cmdGui1.py
      1. QtGUI now integrated PythonUI if available. This means simulation can be controlled both from the QtGUi and the console. The     + standalone PythonUI is available as well.     2. Changed form workspace to MDI windows; main window is menu-only thing that hides when simulation is open.     3. other minor changes.
      1. Replace foreach with FOREACH, based on discussion with Janek.     2. Fix FileGenerateor message crash without workspace.     3. Fix TimeStepper choosable at the same time as fixed timestep. There is some problem with switching back to timestepper, use Omega().usesTimeStepper=True/False from python for now, please.
      1. Merging containers and iterators and iteratorpointers to one .hpp. (Proxy headers created, no existign code affected)     2. Moving default containers for interactions, bodies and physicalAction to core; therefore, omega is constructed with out-of-the-box usable Metabody. (no code affected, though some initializations are now redundant)     3. Dropped workspace mode of QtGUI, since for some weeks no-one complained.     4. Big simplification of QtGUI (no dynamic menus and the like), to allow Views to be opened from python, independently of the simulation controller and so on.     5. Initial wrapper for gui stuff in python, in module yade.qt (View(),Controller(),center())     6. Exiting the python interpreted (^D, quit()) will close yade main window as well.     7. Moved python wrapper helpers to gui/py/pyAttrUtils.hpp to be usable from elsewhere.
      Fix: move files properly (with svn)
      Forgotten add.
      MetaBody still needs InteractingGeometry, BoundingVolume and PhysicalParameters initialized. But that would mean moving more classes to core, which is questionable. For now, fix that in Python and still rely on user init in other code (as before, but less).
      1. Fix passing .py to PythonUI (local vars shadowing global ones); fixes default-test.py as well.     2. Fallback to PythonUI automatically if $DISPLAY is not defined in shell     3. Ignore closing YadeQtMainWindow if it doesnt exist instead of throwing exception
      1. Arguments can be passed to scripts, propagated as yade.runtime.args     2. default-test more robust, with e-mail report
      Update testing script for automated tests
      Micro fix in python script.
      Cleanups for ubuntu package builds.
      1. Other fixes related to deb packages (jobs=1 because of fakeroot :-( )     2. transversal strain sensors max speed can only be positive in USCT
      Fix for crashing from python-constructed rootbody. Hopfully other things are not broken.
      Fix player crashes (dialogs should have no parents)
      Fix setting timeStepper / fixed timestep from the qt3 ui
      Build qt3 with python disabled cleanly.
      1. Add std::string Engine::label, which user can set to identify an engine by arbitrary label     2. Fix warnings in SpatialQuickSortCollider     3. Set isDynamic in rootBody by default     4. Remove PlotDataGetter, superseded by PeriodicPythonRunner     5. New abstract class for running things in predefined periods PeriodicEngine
      Forgotten file.
      1. Fix sync mode in qt3 ui.     2. Fix real time display in qt3 ui.     3. Fix resizing of controller in qt3 ui (childs expand now)     4. Remove deprecated PythonRecorder (superseded by PeriodicPythonRunner)     5. Initialize Omega timers also at construction-time rather than simulation-loading only as it used to be.     6. Don't print bogus values of iters/sec in controller at startup.
      1. Fix the priodic engine.     2. Add layout to the main windows with 4 buttons.     3. Fix PeriodicPythonRunner plugin installation     4. Update simple-scene-graph.py so that it works after latest plotting changes.
      1. Add the possibility to save as gnuplot figure to the plotting interface     2. Add PeriodicEngine (fixed period) as opposed to RangePeriodicEngine (variable period)     3. Make BrefcomDamageColorizer subclass of PeriodicEngine instead of doing Omega::instance().getIteration()%interval==0     4. Change some icons in the UI     5. Add 'scale' parameter to loading spheres from file
      1. Fix segfault in GUI exception trap     2. Handle .xml.gz and .xml.bz2 (in addition to .xml) as command-line argument in QtGUI
      Small fixes here and there. Merged from https://code.launchpad.net/~yade-team/yade/t2. All changes here:
      1. Add list<string> MetaBody::tags, which hold metadata in the key=value format; this is to workaround current serialization that errors out on map<string,string> in findType.     2. Add meanStress and vlumetricStrain to Triaxial for python access     3. add neverDamage flag to Brefcom which forces elastic behavior regardless off strain magnitude.     4. Fix some warnings in STLImporter regarding signedness     5. add __attribute__((unused)) to a variable in Wm3Matrix3 that was not used during optimized builds - to avoid warning.
      1. Fix tagging, do it as list<string>; must NOT contain spaces!     2. Adapt python to that (replaces spaces automatically and so on)
      Forgotten variable after move
      Fixes for g++-4.3 compatibility (still some warnings, may need -fpermissive to compile)
      1. Small fixes here and there     2. In brefcom, make the parameter set richer     3. PythonUI now may be run in non-interactive mode (batch processing)     4. new function Omega().interactions.nth(n) for getting random interaction
      Microfix: unitialized diffuseColor in boundingVolume
      1. Remove failing and unused screw generator.     2. Add rate-dependence variables to brefcom     3. Add raw attribute access from python, like this:     	gm=GeometricalModel("Facet")     	gm.setRaw('vertices',"[{1 2 3} {4 5 6} {7 8 9}]")     to provide access to attributes the current wrapper doesn't wrap properly (i.e. anything beyond numbers, bools, strings and flat arrays of numbers: e.g. vector<Vector3r>, as in Facet). The format of the raw string is that of XMLFormatManager.
      1. Triaxial now calculates thickness of the walls automatically (from the extents of the first wall)     2. Add flags to scons, for the gold linker (doesn't link plugins, oh well)     3. Many fixes in brefcom     4. flag needsInitializers moved into MetaBody and it is checked at every iteration; assigning initializers from python sets this flag. It is set to true in MetaBody constructor.     5. Added wrapper for postProcessAttributes in python, for Facets. Serializable::postProcessAttributes was made public due to that (don't kill me).     6. A few things added to yade.utils     7. SimulationController now correctly handles decreasing timestep mantissa from 1 (goes to 9 and exponent is decreased by 1) and increasing it from 9.
      1. Parallel engine that runs engines in parallel; python wrapper for that     2. Added simple-scene-parallel.py for an example (sppedup of 16% over simple-scene.py)     3. Added openmp flags to scons (enabled by default)     4. Simultaneous builds of multiple profiles: scons profile=default,opt will run all the machinery     5. Refactored grid-drawing code; press 'x','y','z' to have grids with that normal     6. Ported some things from GLViewer to GLSimulationPlayerViewer (grid and mouse events)
      1. Fix the simple-scene-parallel.py (interactionGeometry and interactionPhysics may _not_ be run in parallel)     2. Fix the #pragma clause in ParallelEngine (it did not run in parallel before, but still there were performance gains ?!)     3. When saving simulation, set the filename so that it can be reloaded from the GUI
      1. PositionOrientationRecorder save to bzip2'ed files now; player is able to read both compressed and uncompressed files for backward compatibility.     2. Unsucessful try to use glut for drawing spheres; left as an option that is disabled by default, however.     3. Fixes in brefcom     4. Simulation player now has progress window and supports strides when loading files.     5. Fix wrong timestamp format in saveGnuplot in gui/py/plot.py (%m instead of %M)
      1. Implemented clipping planes in the GL viewer and GL renderer     2. Moving body is now consistent with mouse bindings for moving scene
      Remove duplicated code in GLSimulationPlayerViewer, subclass from GLViewer.
      Median centering routine (for cases where one body went nuts and centerScene will make the whole a small point) - activated with Alt-C (both controller and viewer)
      1. Added displacement and rotation scaling to the OpenGLRenderingEngine (accessible from the renderer config). Documentation missing as of now. Displacements from reference point will be scaled in the rendering. At this moment, only geometrical model and a few other elements of the GL display are scaled.
      1. Double-click aligns clipping planes if manipulated, x,y,z aligns normal with axis.     2. Default number of clipping planes is 3 instead of 2 now.     2. Fix compilation error in ResetPositionEngine (missing logger)
      1. sqlite3-dev is now required for yade (checked by scons)     2. sqlite3x c++ sqlite3 wrapper is in our tree (5 files, about 60kb of code), built by scons     3. Check for boost::regex     4. Experimental SQLiteRecorder (the player side is not yet supported at all!)     5. Remove messages at startup about singletons (define YADE_DEBUG env var to get them again)     6. StretchPeriodicEngine that will eventually replace the overdesigned RangePeriodicEngine
      Fix logger error at startup.
      1. Remove some warnings about persistentInteractions initialization (initialization is done in MetaBody constructor anyway, it can not break anything);     2. Remove long obsolete pyade     3. Add Omega::getComputationTime     4. Add Omega::saveSimulationToStream and Omega::loadSimulationFromStream     5. Improve the SQLiteRecorder: put simulation into the db, create table with pointers to other tables, declare column types. The recording part is almost done. Implementation in player is to be done.
      1. Move FiltrEngine from core to common (I know this is arguable, given that DeusExMachina and StandAloneEngine are in core as well. I think, however, that common is a more appropriate place since these engines are not as important...)     2. Completed the recording sqlite part     3. Completed the player part of sqlite (in player)     4. Added libsqlite3-dev to debian build depends     5. PeriodicEngine now is activated when the priod is reached, not afterwards (> vs. >=)
      Other fixes. Please not in GLSimulationPlayerViewer I had to comment one line that I didn't know how to make compile (dynamic-Cast).
      1. Set iteration number with sqlite as well
      1. Views, Player, Controller and Generator can be opened asynchronously from python now.     2. Revamped the player UI, hopefully making it better.     3. Added Alt-S for saving viewer state (camera etc)     4. Added runPlayer to python for aotomatized replay. The file contains instructions for offscreen thereof rendering as well.
      Re-enable sega's code that doesn't compile here.
      1. qtCreateVideo creates video from the replay snapshots directly (using gstreamer)     2. qt.{Player,Generator,Controller} now take an optional bool; if true (_not_ default), they will not return until the requested window will have been created and ready.     3. runPlayer return wildcard and list of snapshot files now     4. Adapted simple-scene-player.py to reflect that.
      Fix linking issue.
      1. new class DisplayParameters is a string->string "hash map" for holding various configurations.     2. Multiple display parameters (i.e. QGLViewer config and OpenGLRenderingEngine config) are stored in Metabody.     4. stopAtIteration moved to MetaBody so that it is saved and reloaded (MetaBody::recover hack is gone)     5. Remove unnecessary persistentInteraction initializers so that we have less warnings     6. Remove deprecated RangePeriodicEngine, plotting uses StretchPeriodicEngine instead.     7. Add the ability to load from stream and save to stream to IOFormatManager (afterwards, I discovered there were actually_identical_ functions loadArchive and saveArchive; those were deleted since unused elsewhere)     8. GLViewer can now load and save state from/to string     9. in GLViewer, keys 7,8,9 load display config #0,1,2 and Alt-{7,8,9} saves current view to #0,1,2. Those are saved in MetaBody. BUG: after loading such config, the QtGUI-generated OpenGLRenderingEngine config dialog doesn't work anymore (probably some issue with archives, not sure).     9. Hopefully all xml-parser-offensive characters are escaped at string serialization (and unescaped at deserialization). We use standard SGML escapes (newline=&br; tab=&tab; <=&lt; and so on) now. This allows to save XML-as-string in the xml itself (used for DisplayParameters).     10. GLViewer now properly saves what XYZ planes are displayed (using custom DOM element)     11. Some fixes in Brefcom, more to come.
      1. Fixes in Brefcom     2. Add docstrings to QtGUI-python functions;     3. StretchPeriodicEngine adjusts both limit and period if one of them is nonzero     4. Other fixes in python interface
      Sync with upstream QGLViewer 2.3.0
      1. Experimental scale drawing in GLViewer (disabled by default)     2. Fix (?) race conditions (?) in Omega and python     3. Other fixes in plotting, works now again (remove numpy.array, not needed)
      1. Merge all gravity engines (central, axial, directional (the old one)) into 1 header     2. Cleanups of pkg/common/SConstript     3. Add more brefcom accessors (Fs, Fn, ...)     4. Fix (hopefully) threading issues with python; Omega().pause and other now use Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS to avoid deadlock of the interpreter if called from c++ interpreting python code
      1. Add private functions to eudoxos.py     2. Fix a few broken includes
      Fix #includes in affected files.
      Forgotten file.
      Second file that was forgotten :-|
      1. Omega().interactions.nth returns n-th real interaction     2. Export more brefcom data to python     3. Make LOG_DEBUG and LOG_TRACE no-op in NDEBUG (optimized) builds     4. Change linebreaks from CR+LF to unix LF in a few random diles     5. Make DeusExMachina registerAttributes of Engine     6. Serializer prints offending value if bad_lexical_cast.     7. Attempt to catch exception if reading bool written as int (254 etc) and consider that "true" (doesn't work?)     8. JumpChangeSe3 can set (angular)velocity if requested instead of plain moving
      1. Move refSe3 and dispSe3 to PhysicalParameters; this should speed up the renderer (clipping is done only once etc) and make it possible to apply clipping (via PhysicalParameters::isDisplayed) in GL functors for interactions as well.     2. Add button for setting reference positionts to the controller     3. Remove warnings in NewtonsDampedLaw
      1. Cleanups in OpenGLRenderingEngine, use systematically clipping and scaling     2. Merge GL functor abstract class headers in one (GLDrawFunctors.hpp) and fix files using them     3. Make qt-serialization layout a bit more space-conservative.
      1. Fix default test to report errors during simulation loading as well     2. Fix preprocessors derived from triaxial to not initializa transienInteractions, preventing crash discussed with Bruno: containes for transient and persistent must be the same, for unknown reason.     3. Fix preprocessors using brefcom to define all variables, otherwise we have nan's in XML which crashes the deserializer.
      Add script for making release
      Improved the release script.
      1. Add the ability to block individual DOFs on every body in PhysicalParameters and implement relevant code in both NewtonsDampedLaw and LeapFrog integrators     2. Add that to UniaxialStrainer     3. Put both CundallNonViscous damping classes in one file (cleanup), adapt all files to that
      1. Make the -x flag to PythonUI stop even if no script is provided.
      Fix missing lib (error at startup)

==================================================
yade-0.10.0
Tue Jul 11 13:17:04 2006 +0000

Janek Kozicki (55):
      small correction in INSTALL,     renamed ayde-data to yade-examples, and tagged it.
      added schedule
      added some more instructions to INSTALL file
      I am committing new version of docs, checked by my sister. And briefly checked by me. Olivier, now you can work on it, and remember to copy & paste lots of text and explanations from the article!
      directory for creating packages with yade.
      directory for Czesiu to work on debian packages for yade. later we can add directories for .rpm or gentoo, etc....
      Fixed some broken symlinks. Removed unnecessary int i from MetaBody loops
      added missing -lglut
      yade is compiling with boost 1.33, but I had to make some modifications in ErrorTolerantLaw <- it is compiling, but I'm sure that it Jacobian is WRONG !! - Oliver it's your code, only you can fix that.
      some small changes, before I start something bigger
      ClassFactory is one step closer to windows version
      I have started changes that will make yade compilable on windows
      another step closer to compile yade on windows:
      to compile yade on windows we have to remove symlinks. I started doing that, but it's not finished. I have to commit in the middle
      still removing symlinks...
      symlinks removed. but it is NOT compiling now
      deleted all useless directories
      modyfing all .pro files and Makefiles so that it will compile
      maybe it is compiling...
      so symlinks are now removed, and it is compiling and installing exactly like before.
      So I have started compiling it on windows, and I stopped on the problem that linker cannot link serialization with factory.
      General cleaning of all header files. Now they are much more readable,     and more coherent with C++ coding standards.
      added SDECMovingWall FileGenerator contributed by Andreas Plesch.
      You have decided to rename class: Box2AABB to a new name: InteractingBox2AABB     You have decided to rename class: Sphere2AABB to a new name: InteractingSphere2AABB
      D    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Box2AABB/Box2AABB.pro     D    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Box2AABB/Box2AABB.cpp     D    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Box2AABB/Box2AABB.hpp     A    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Box2AABB/InteractingBox2AABB.pro     A    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Box2AABB/InteractingBox2AABB.cpp     A    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Box2AABB/InteractingBox2AABB.hpp     D    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Sphere2AABB/Sphere2AABB.cpp     D    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Sphere2AABB/Sphere2AABB.hpp     A    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Sphere2AABB/InteractingSphere2AABB.pro     A    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Sphere2AABB/InteractingSphere2AABB.cpp     A    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Sphere2AABB/InteractingSphere2AABB.hpp     D    yade-packages/yade-package-common/src/Engine/EngineUnit/Sphere2AABB/Sphere2AABB.pro
      I hope that scripts to rename classess are still working okay :>
      ErrorTolerantContactModel -> ErrorTolerantContact     AABox2Sphere4ClosestFeatures -> AAInteractingBox2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures     Box2Box4ClosestFeatures -> InteractingBox2InteractingBox4ClosestFeatures     Box2Sphere4ClosestFeatures -> InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures     Box2Sphere4ErrorTolerant -> InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4ErrorTolerantContact     Box2Sphere4MacroMicroContactGeometry -> InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry     Sphere2Sphere4ClosestFeatures -> InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures     Sphere2Sphere4ErrorTolerant -> InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4ErrorTolerantContact     Sphere2Sphere4MacroMicroContactGeometry -> InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry
      continued...
      this renaming is DONE
      GLDrawInteractionBox -> GLDrawInteractingBox     GLDrawInteractionGeometryFunctor -> GLDrawInteractingGeometryFunctor     GLDrawInteractionSphere -> GLDrawInteractingSphere     GLDrawInteractionGeometrySet -> GLDrawMetaInteractingGeometry
      renaming continued..
      renamig DONE
      Serialization::registerAttributes() is now protected, as it should be.     renamed MetaBody::actors to engines
      added:
      QtEngineEditor is not working - doesn't detect correctly StandAloneEngines
      - can save simulation from simulation controller     - can change background color of the simulation displayed
      binary serialization for yade - looks like it is working :)
      fixed one bug in BINFormatManager     fixed savig ElasticContactParameters and SpheresContactGeometry, so that after loading the simulation is not going crazy     added several try/catch blocks     removed GLAPI and GLAPIENTRY from OpenGLWrapper     XMLSaxParser is now better at counting lines
      I have just enabled commit-email.pl for SVN. we should get info about commits for yade-dev, I wonder it if works :)
      not so small bugfixes and imprvements:
      - fixed serious bug in bool BodyRedirectionVector::erase(unsigned int);     - added function bool exists() const; to BodyContainer     - graphical display now has reversed meaning of scrollwheel, so it is now similar to behaviour of blender and autocad     - SDECLinkedSpheres is working after some (surprise!) quick hack. That part is still waiting for total rewrite.     - big improvements in lattice model. beam bending works (but not always) with axis+angle notation. maybe with quaternions it will be better. There is a problem that shows itself when using regular triangular grid.
      - added function Quaternion::power(RealType)     - lattice bending works now in 2d (X-Y plane), using angles. not vectors or quaternions. I will do 3d later.
      - 'cancel' when loading filegenerator is not crashing now     - started non-local model for lattice     - hopefully 2d lattice beams are now okay.
      middle button in 3d view is now "PAN" command, not "ZOOM" as it used to be.     It's more similar to AutoCAD
      'yade -h' will now display compilation flags (currently only DOUBLE_PRECISION - how about adding long double ;) ?)
      small fix so yade works with lates kubuntu:
      Threadable class has been removed:     - when yade is idle 0% of CPU is consumed by the display,     - when simulation is ran it is in separate thread, second processor (if       present) is drawing on the screen,     - with two processors theoretically QtGUI should have speed equal to NullGUI,     - drawing on the screen is not synchronized, so some bodies are from previous       iteration, some are from next iteration (later there will be an option to       turn synchronization ON - it will slow down computations a bit)
      Renaming SimulationLoop to SimulationRunner.
      renaming finished. SimulationLoop -> SimulationRunner
      deleted yade-lib-threads,     added SimulationRunner, that can start/stop or perform singleLoop of simulation     in separate thread.
      final touches to SimulationRunner
      compilation fix
      yade-flat now allows to debug yade from inside kdevelop
      SimulationController is now updating iterations/time and sets time step correctly.
      updated INSTALL file (before release).

Olivier Galizzi (10):
      Corrected one missing include into yade-package-lattice so that it is compiling
      Added new yade-spherical-dem-simulator plugin. It is compiling but I have not tested it for now.     This plugin will be used to compare yade performances to a dedicated simulator that can only run simulation on spheres and which is not extensible.
      Corrected some symlinks (forgot to call symlinks -rcs)
      Improvement into SphericalDEMSimulator
      SphericalDEMSimulator is now working. But maybe an error remains because for now it is 10x faster than yade !!
      Started to add SimulationPlayer plugin to QtGUI
      Some small optimisation of Math library. Some if statement where remaining after     an assert that were doing the same check.
      Improvement into SphericalDEMSimulator and QtSimulationPlayer.
      SimulationPlayer is now working; but there is no check to see is the files     exists or not, so it is up to the user to be carefull (at least for now)
      Minor changes into NullGUI.

==================================================
yade-0.09.0
Sun Aug 21 20:41:37 2005 +0000

Janek Kozicki (34):
      fixed some broken symlinks
      removed inifinite loop when loading plugins
      fixed setDebug and setRelease scripts. Set everything to debug.
      added yade-flat - it is very useful for debugging, because command:
      fixed some Makefiles  - changed   make  to   $(MAKE)     corrected invalid usage of postfix increment++
      changed Makefiles, so that qmake respects INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR
      corrected a mistake
      another correction in Makefiles
      still fixind Makefiles, should be OK now...
      So now I think that Makefiles are OK. But I've discovered a mistake in .pro,     when trying to install to totally custom directory (for example /home/joe/work ).     So I'm committing this before fixing that.
      so by default /usr/local/include is searched for include files. INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR     modify this path automatically. So that there is no problem to install yade as a normal     non root user, in home directory.
      all Makefiles are tested and are working. following commmands were tested (launched from trunk/ directory)
      I started renaming SpheresContactGeometry to MacroMicroContactGeometry,     and also I am testing new fixed renaming scripts!
      still testing renaming scripts...
      after this commit I'll know if scripts are correct
      fixing item no. 35 in yade-core/.todo
      fixing item no. 35 in yade-core/.todo
      Finished fixing item no. 35 in yade-core/.todo
      renaming: SDECTimeStepper ElasticCriterionTimeStepper
      SDECTimeStepper -> ElasticCriterionTimeStepper
      finished     SDECTimeStepper -> ElasticCriterionTimeStepper

      ./yade-scripts/renameClassFilenames InteractionDescriptionSet2AABB MetaInteractingGeometry2AABB
      ./yade-scripts/renameClassDirectories InteractionDescriptionSet2AABB MetaInteractingGeometry2AABB
      updated Changelog
      M    trunk/Changelog     D    tags/yade-0.1
      M    trunk/Changelog
      preparing for release.
      is compiling with DOUBLE_PRECISION
      corrected instructions in INSTALLs text files.
      ok, I think that this version is ready for release
      added dependencies diagram
      started tagging releases. renemed top directory QtGUI to yade-gui-qt. Just like XMLFormatManager
      tagged all new releases!

Olivier Galizzi (19):
      Better YadeQtMainWindow. Now menus are displayed in menu bar in the same order     they are added in the program.
      Added preferences for QtGUI. Now it remembers size and position and exit.
      Now it is possible to choose time step from GUI.
      Created directory yade-plugins to store all yade unfisnished plugins     Added iteratortest to test iterator on polymorphic container
      Improved version of polymorphic iterator
      Splitted files in iteratortest so there is one class per file
      I have introduced iterators for all types of containers in order to remove the     dirty gotoFirst, gotoNext, hasNext and notAtEnd methods.     Now it looks like more like stl iterators.     It is compiling but unfortunately it is segfaulting at runtime, probably some     problems in ++,* operators.
      Yade is now working with iterator. At least all configurations generated by some     FileGenerator are working.
      Added some improvement into GLEngineEditor. For that I have rewritten a big part of yade-lib-opengl because it was not possible to delete windows without corrupting the id of the others windows.
      Added Makefile to compile and install all packages at once.
      Better design : added class related to MetaEngine.     Removed all references to Serialization stuff into yade-lib-multimethod. They are now into newly added classes.
      Some cleaning in MetaEngine hpp and cpp.     Some improvement into QtEngineEditor
      Improvements into QtEngineEditor. Now it is olamost possible to create     graphically a simultation loop.Now I have to make something to set parameter of     MetaEngines.
      Improvement into QtEngineEditor     Moved REGISTER_CLASS_NAME from Serializable to Factorable and started to add     REGSITER_BASE_CLASS_NAME to all Factorable classes. With those two macro we'll     be able to build into Omega for example the class tree and then reuse it     everywhere it is needed. For example it will be usefull to create GUI that want to deal only with this or this type of class.
      Now all classes register their base class name.
      Removed unused classes.
      Fixed some compiletion errors.     Added Makefile to compile the whole trunk at once.
      Improvement int QtEngineEditor.     Now only correct EngineUnit and base base are displayed thank's to the     REGISTER_BASE_CLASS_NAME macro.
      Simulation loop editing is now working. There are still some random crashes to     fix and for now it is not possible to load a simulation loop.

==================================================
yade-0.08.6
Fri Jul 1 15:36:47 2005 +0000

Olivier Galizzi (14):
      Added some functions into yade-lib-computational-geometry     Started to and graphical interface for buliding simulation loop and initializer list
      Added ommitted files QtEngineEditor.*
      Added unused class MetaEngine, MetaDispatchingEngine2D and MetaDispatchingEngine1D.     I wanted to make something easier for the user but it is not working now.
      Updates into QtGeneratedCodeGenerator.ui.     Started to implement the GUI
      Updates in Omega : now foreach plugins we store if it is indexable, factorable     or serializable.     Improved code generation : Data class, engine and dispatching engine works. No     stuff is done for generation of kdevelop projects.
      All libs use now $(YADEDYNLIBPATH)/yade-libs directory as output path. Some changes had to be made in most of the .pro files.     Added a preference editor in QTGUI
      Attempt to use Yade without environnement variable. I am closer to the solution but it is still not working.
      Small change so that yade is compiling with qglviewer 2.0
      No there is no need to set up and environnement variable to run yade.     Of course because the libs are still into a local dir your LD_LIBRARY_PATH     should point to this local folder.
      Yade is now working and compiling.
      Started to move yade-lib-gui-qt back to plugins
      yade-lib-gui-qt moved back to plugins
      Yade is now compiling fine.     I removed qyade and nyade since they are not needed anymore.
      Added user manual without pictures. But .tex is compiling well.

==================================================
yade-0.08.5
Sun Jun 19 23:01:35 2005 +0000

Janek Kozicki (5):
      it's compiling now with gcc 3.3
      added warining in Omega.cpp when trying to scan non existing directory for dynlibs
      added missing 'virtual' to destructors of some classess - I had random compiler/startup errors because of that.
      openGL problem fixed - yade must link with -lglut, and display works.
      Lattice works with rods, but dirty, of course - as always when something is implemented for the first time :>

Olivier Galizzi (6):
      All EngineUnit now link with their corresponding MetaEngine otherwise findType doesn't work ! Why ... I don't know ! :)     Because EngineUnit only use the abstract class contained inside corresponding MetaEngine dynlib and nothing else ...
      To make yade deserialization working I had to modify PointerHandler.tpp around line 90.     Basically I just remplaced a dynamic_cast by a reinterpret_cast. We have to find why dynamic_cast is not working anymore !
      Added some dynlibs for handling swept sphere volume.
      Tetrahedron are almost working. A bug into SWIFT is still causing troubles.
      Some changes into SweptSphere and Tetrahedron
      Putting some stupid name for 2 enum in Typelist.hpp (l 518 and 520) so that yade     is compiling with gcc 4. Gcc 4 do not accept anymore anonymous enum type !

==================================================
yade-0.08.4
Mon May 23 12:51:50 2005 +0000

Janek Kozicki (1):
      added -lpthread in some places, so it is compiling with g++ 3.3

Olivier Galizzi (17):
      Removing MarchingCube GeometricalModel (because it is not a GeometricalModel !)
      Renaming PhysicalActionEngineUnit to PhysicalActionDamperUnit and PhysicalActionApplierUnit     Added class Preferences that contain directory to dynlibs.     Modification of library yade-lib-factory so that it is using multiple directories to look for requested dynlib
      Removing remaining directory toolboxes
      Started to split include files of libraries into different directories.     Started to change all #include "lib" to #include <yade-lib*/lib>
      Corrected some wrong #include stuff
      All include files from plugins/pre and post processor are now into     include/yade-common. This is not final destination but it is closer to want we     want. All #include stuff are modified according to this new structure.
      Added script countNbLines that count the number of lines of code of the project
      Starting renaming SimpleSpringLaw to FrictionLessElasticContactLaw
      Renaming SimpleSpringLaw to FrictionLessElasticContactLaw
      Renaming SimpleSpringLaw to FrictionLessElasticContactLaw
      SimpleSpringLaw renamed to FrictionLessElasticContactLaw.     Yade is compiling.
      Improved documentation : added introduction to YADE
      Improved documentation
      Added librarie swift++ and qhull.     Modified scripts so that they works with .h and .c files.
      Added MarchingCube algorithm into yade-lib-computationnal-geometry     Created lib yade-lib-algorithms were to gather algorithms of different type :     for now there is only a PerlinNoise algorithm, but we can put here sorting     algorithm ...
      Moving, renaming some directories before splitting
      Added new file generator Funnel and TetrahedronsTest     Added new interactingGeometry PolyhedralSweptSphere     Added new NarrowInteractionGeometryEngine SwiftPolyhedronProximityModeler that     will use SWIFT++ library and PolyhedralSweptSphere     Added EngineUnit Tetrahedron2PolyhedralSweptSphere and Box2PolyhedralSweptSphere     that will build InteractingGeometry

yade-0.08.1
Wed Apr 27 16:51:17 2005 +0000

Janek Kozicki (348):
      deleted file makeSymLink, and corrected calling scripts, when current directory is not in $PATH - just added ./ everywhere
      better scripts - easier to use
      better script to switch dynlib on/off, but still not good enough
      removed spaces at the end of line
      Multimethods work! but class Factorable MUST be added, to clean mess with CollisionFunctor
      correcten compile dependencies - builds again from command line
      corrected (again) compile dependencies
      removed couple of compiler warnings
      added yade/scripts/setDebug yade/scripts/setRelease
      added FIXME about serialization, and Omega constructor tells about -rdynamic flag
      added comments into MAIN LOOP (currently inside NonConnexBody)
      scripts now check if YADEPATH was set
      scripts now checking if YADEPATH set, othervise tell user to set it
      moving GUI to frontend
      moved GUI to FrontEnd
      added FactoryExceptions so that ClassFactory is reusable
      fixed ArchiveTypes.hpp:FIXME : change SMART_POINTER to POINTER and STL_CONTAINER to CONTAINER
      added ClassFactory snippet, in order to clean it and make reusable
      ClassFactory now should be really reusable
      starting work with Serialization (spirit)
      preparing yade to use reusable snippets - do not modify those files inside yade! do it in snippets instead
      now yade uses exactly the same files as snippets. DO NOT MODIFY THEM, modify snippets first, then copy here.
      now yade uses boost::spirit, DO NOT MODIFY, work on snippets instead
      little cleanup, before making resetable rootBody
      corrected spirit. DO NOT MODIFY, please test on snippets first.
      now hanging cloth uses fundamental variable [ {1 {2 3 4}} {1 {2 3 4}} ... ]
      we started adding SDEC element. now SDECTestExample works. but not rotating box. and we need to clean stuff
      SDECDynamicEngine starts to work with contact law
      moving CollisionModel into CollisionGeometry
      changing *PhaseCollider into *Collider
      changing *PhaseCollider into *Collider (2)
      changing *PhaseCollider into *Collider (3)
      changed *PhaseCollider into *Collider, now starting with qmake static libraries inside yade directory
      now yade accepts more arguments on input: filename, timestep, maxiter
      added benchmark - we can easily test speed changes of yade
      CollllisionFunctor does NOT need to derive from Indexable!, rearranging subprojects
      changes in Math directory...
      more changes in directory tree (I must commit between changes...)
      more changes in directory tree (I must commit between changes... 2)
      moving files around
      ...still not compiling..
      i must commit before I move directories..
      looks like I've found a solution for qmake...
      looks like I've found a solution for qmake...2
      finally! rearrangement of qmake/yade subtree. Serialization must be a dynlib!! it is absolutely not working as a static library!!, Omega must be freed from dependency on Vector3, this causes lots of problems (4hours to find it), 12h total, wheeeew. I Hope this work is not useless...
      CollisionFunctor derived or not, from Indexable? (in g++3.3 if YES - it's faster, but rather uncorrect...)
      now compiles with g++3.3, that was darn difficult to figure out, and is not slower than 94 svn status -q :)
      correction in SDECDynamicEngine with PermanentLinks, and Quaternion precise rotation
      added tetrahedron with permanent links, and -a flag, to say if we want autostart computations
      added NullGUI, and -p flag
      SDECBenchmark8k.xml is working now.
      added two more examples
      not working moment law - just after implementing it with JP
      wtf with euler angle on y direction???
      added SDECMoreTetrahedronsWithLinksMDEM3D.xml
      this one works stable, but bad:  data/SDECPermanentChainRotated.xml
      corrected SDECRotatingBoxWithTetrahedrons.xml and FileGenerator/RotatingBox/RotatingBox.cpp
      added LinkedSpheres filegenerator,     small note inside Translatro.cpp - so that we can reproduce strange bahaviour     changed order of REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES in NonConnexBody - interactions are first     SDECDynamiCEngine has damping 0.3 now (should be attribute!!)
      added SDECCollision.xml - looks really good with timestep 0.003(FIXME - should be inside .xml) and moment law uncommented(FIXME) in SDECDynamicEngine
      XMLManager says line number of .xml if serialization fails, at least sometimes...
      Serializtion now supports:  std::map, Loki::AssocVector, std::list, std::deque, std::set, std::vector, std::pair, boost::tuple1/2/3/4/5
      corrected all .pro files to include toolboxes/Libraries/AssocVector - so that yade now compiles and runs good with all that new serialization stuff
      createIncludes script corrected, Makefile removed
      this version of file is used to make comparision of results with Jean Patrick
      corrected - works with current (unfinished) containers
      moved Singleton.hpp to toolboxes/Libraries/Singleton - place where it belongs
      now yade works with new serialization - added beforeSerialization, afterSerialization, beforeDeserialization, afterDesrialization
      removed class Contact, in prepare for interactionContainer
      added InteractionContainer (not integrated yet)
      InteractionContainer integrated into yade
      InteractioContainer eraseCurrent() useful for SAPColider
      BodyContainer starts to work
      BodyContainer with ids works, now I havr to move it into yade/Body, yade/Interaction
      InteractionContainer and BodyContainer integration completed. but container classes quality/speed is not good (and tested) yet
      InteractionVecSet and BodyVector
      FIXED threading on multi-processor machine (not real multiprocessor, just hyper threading...)
      rename BodyVector to BodyRedirectionVector
      corrected BodyRedirectionVector, added comment in Singleton
      scripts that allow easy switching between relative paths and paths in environemnt YADE*PATH variables
      threads are now crashing little less often... (only when clicking "new view" "start" "stop")
      XMLManager writes pointers in a shorter way, with _className_
      preProcessAttributes postProcessAttributes
      converted SDECBenchmark8k.xml
      NullGUI works - for benchmars of Vector3 not in Serializable, etc..
      scripts are checking all Environement Variables - more safety
      fixed missing is_base_and_derived in Indexable.hpp
      started with OpenGLWrapper and removed extra tabs in serialization
      OpenGLWrapper starts to work - now to write all those functions from gl.h
      OpenGLWrapper 50% done  - and #DOUBLE_PRECISION works! (float/double)
      improved SDECLinkedSpheres (momwnt law is not workingsvn status -q)
      SDECCollision.xml is loading correctly, but is not working!!! - it was working previously!!
      SDECCollision.xml works for dt=0.003
      SDECCollision.xml and SDECTetrahedronWithLinks.xml work for dt=0.003
      SDECLinkedSpheres example now is much more interesteing, with dt=0.003
      fixed hack in PointerHandler, fixed SDECBenchmark8k, some .pro were release, not debug
      ok, this problem in IOManager.cpp is strange...
      rearranging directories.
      changing directories cd...

      Finished rearranging subdirectories. Now we have directory extensions (we can rename it,     if there is a better name), and ClassFactory is in toolbox/Libraries, Multimethods (once there     are done) should go there too, because MultiMethods have nothing to do with yade.
      yade is now compiling (and works) with g++ 3.3
      all .xml examples except ErrorTolerant, are now working
      NullGUI is now saving results during computations. Those results can be opened     with QtGUI and we can see what is computed.
      added filegenerator that can import data files from SDEC
      hack, which must be corrected just after adding Action, allows to measure forces     during simulation
      InteractionVecSet is corrected and working, yade is now compiling withi double (there was     some mistake with float), but all the examples are now broken!
      yade is now crashing less often, so I hope that we will never again see that error:
      again was not compiling with double....
      corrected some threading problems, removed MyEngine2 from DynamicEngine.pro, because it doesn't exist
      added SopeTest in SimulationController
      -pthreads -lpthreads are required for yade to compile with 3.3!! don`t remove them!!!!
      added some comments to code regarding integration with new multimethods
      started integration of multimethods
      integrating new multimethods, continued...
      1D, 2D MultiMethods are working in yade. but there is a bug in DynLibDispatcher, current workaround is done with a hack
      added some comments to working multimethods, hack is little better, but not removed, yet
      Multimethods are now working, clean, checked with valgrind, and results from older version are compared with kompare.
      added two postprocessors - recording forces, and average position. but why they crash Omega.loadDynLibs(), when I use ofstream???
      force recorder is not modifying data anymore, but anyway it`s dirty and must use Action, and work like real sensors!!
      SDECImport uses new dialog box
      changes into Interaction and Interaction container:
      version 0.1.5, with many changes:     - moment rotation law added, mess inside SDECDynamicEngine (three enegines in one!)     - Serialization now supports almost all std, boost and Loki containers and more     - math classes are separate from serialization, and done with templates (but with wild-magic license)     - for storing Bodies and Interactions we now use polymorphic classes InteractionContainer and BodyContainer     - yade uses threads now, but still not fully stable     - switch at compile time to select float/double precision of calculation     - displayed objects are now casting really cool shadows     - some examples are not updated, and therefor not working. it is guaranteed that SDECBenchmark8k will always work.     - BoundingVolume optimized for each kind of GeometricalModel makes computation almost twice faster     - new very generic MultiMethods are added, allowing multivirtual call with extra parameters, and easy code reuse
      added changelog
      small correction in Interaction constructor
      putting Real in all places where it is used for calculation
      was not compiling because of stupid .pro problems
      renamed DynLibLauncher to FunctorWrapper
      changing name from SDECContactModel to SDECContactModel - but not tested yet - I must commit between subversion operations
      SDECContactModel renamed to SDECContactGeometry, OK
      renaming BroadCollider, NarrowCollider to BroadInteractor, NarrowInteractor, part 1
      still renaming
      finished renaming BroadCollider, NarrowCollider to BroadInteractor, NarrowInteractor
      changed color of sphere number 1 and 10 - this is for checking the shearForce between those spheres (as we had numerically different results for float and double)
      some cleaning before ActionContainer
      some .pro conflicts, now it's compiling, still before ActionContainer
      added empty class ActionVecVec
      I added empty classes ActionForce and ActionMomentum, because I need something that ActionContainer can store     classes are empty now.
      So, now all classes are added: Action, ActionVecVec, ActionContainer, ActionForce, ActionMomentum, etc.. but they are empty. And it is compiling
      abstract interface for ActionContainer is specified, now to fill in the class ActionVecVec ....
      work inside ActionVecVec - not done yet, but is compiling
      corrected compilation order (except for CollisionGeometrySet, which is a sign bigger design flaw, than just a compilation order) and xorrected SDECBenchmark8k.xml so that it is running with latest modifications
      ActionContainer->reset() - resetting actions without deleting all the pointers - faster
      changed the way in which ActionContainer works, now all fields are never empty.     DynamicEngine (or some other actor?), when if(first) must call ActionContainer->prepare(),     and then ActionContainer works much faster.
      added flat kdevelop project, this is for debugging - I don't know why, but alleyoop is not showing line numbers inside dynlibs, now...
      finad() and getCurrent() in containers are now returning references, as it should be faster
      Body is Indexable, but we have to register SDECDiscreteElement to dispatcher, not RigidBody... it's a bug in Indexable class, or somewhere there...
      Multimethods now support inheritance in Indexable objects, I had to modify in Indexable class:
      possibly faster DynLibDispatcher, I was also trying to fix problem that Singleton is not deleted at end, but finally I made only some improvement, but it is still not fixed.
      renaming CollisionFunctor to InteractionFunctor, part 1
      renaming, part 2
      renaming, part 4
      renaming, part 5
      renaming, part 6
      finished renaming of InteractionFunctor, and I also corrected colors in qt dialog, and qt simulation-controller window. But I'm not sure about colors in qt dialog.
      small change in ActionDispatcher.cpp, is faster, but if Action was holding body's id it is possible that it can be faster
      corrected SDECBenchmark8k.xml, and I've checked that visually simulation is the same as previous version

      so it is compiling, except for CollisionGeometrySet problem
      OpenGL display works with strange static_cast inside DynLibDispatcher
      started with PositionOrientationRecorder
      changed double to Real in few remaining places. small fixes in multimethods.

      renaming mess..
      classes aggregated by Body have a prefix 'Body' in their name, to reduce confusion of class names:
      fixed OpenGL display of cloth, and still renaming classess aggregated by Body
      Loki library in single place, but it should be renamed to SmallLoki, or YadeLoki, because this is not an exact copy of Loki library.
      added FactoryFunctors and UpdatorFunctors for BoundingVolume, GeometricalModel, etc... They are empty for now
      Loki ok (just should be SmallLoki, or YadeLoki), BodyAssocVec ->  BodyAssocVector
      because of name conflict between Body::InteractionGeometry and Interaction::InteractionGeometry, maybe name Body::InteractionDescription will be ok?     this is what I've renamed in this commit
      so now we have (arrow <- means 'aggregates'):
      renaming cd..
      renaming cd..
      renaming cd..
      before renaming InteractionFunctor-s to InteractionGeometryFunctor-s
      little renaming/cleaning is finished.
      problem with InteractionDescriptionSet is solved, and now yade just compiles without any errors!
      I have done some general cleaning - removed unnecessary constructors, deleted unused postProcessAttributes, etc..
      OK/Cancel works now in file selection dialog,     ActionForce2RigidBody was deleted, because ActionForce2Particle does the same job     now I'm staring to work on updating GeometricalModel of Mesh2D, so that cloth will be displayed properly
      changed names RigidBody to RigidBodyParameters and so on
      before making correct display of cloth geometrical model I have to move Geometry into Body, because Body owns geometry, and it will not compile if I don;t move it there.
      all renaming finished for now. so I'll start with proper update of geometrical model for cloth.
      update of GeometricalModel for cloth is working
      is compiling now with g++ 3.3, and with double
      FunctorWrapper is Serializable, now - because we want Dispatcher to work with serialization, so that Functors can get extra arguments from .xml
      Functors are serializable, so now I'm working on DynLibDispatcher to support this serialization of functors
      Serializable functors are working, so now I'll separate damping from SDECDynamicEngine. It will be a functor, with parameters.
      preaparations for ActionDampingFunctor, corrected SDECBenchmark8k.xml
      damping is separated from SDECDynamicEngine and works, strange is that ActionDampingDispatcher and ActionApplyDispatcher are exactly the same!! so they should be merged into one dispatcher. maybe Action2BodyPhysicalParametersDispatcher
      damping works quite good
      added ActionReset - it is not inside SDECDynamicEngine - because for cloth example we have two/three engines, so they can't do a reset - because they will delete results from other engine
      renamed:
      stared with RotatingBox with simplespring, filegenerator...
      RotatingBox example with spheres and boxes inside is working quite good - with SimpleSpringDynamicEngine
      BoxStack example is working quite good. meybe it should be renamed to WallImpact, or something like that...
      the real name for damping is: Cundall Non Viscous Local Damping
      TimeStepper is working quite nice, and now - even SDECLinkedSpheres example is stable!
      SDECParameters is now holding shearingAngle, young modulus and posiions ratio - as it should.
      internal shearing angle is added, and yade is ready to compare results with sdec, although force recorder is little dirty, because it is releasing the bug ball
      some small corrections, before comparing results with sdec
      splitting leapfrom integrator into two parts....
      added velocity recorder, and timeintegrator is split in two parts
      started with lattice model
      Lattice model generation starts to work.
      SDECImport can also create walls made of spheres
      Body::group changed into Body::groupMask (so bodies can belong to many groups - max. 16 groups, because we have 16 bits here)
      supid error everywhere!!! volume of a spohere was 4/3*PI*radius*radius, EVERYWHERE!!!. the volume of a sphere should be calculated in ONLY one place!!!
      so now we will make another comparision with SDEC, after sphere volume was fixed
      renaming DynamicEngine to InteractionLaw     renaming KinematicEngine to KinematicMotion
      DynamicEngine -> InteractionLaw     KinematicEngine -> KinematicMotion
      renaming
      DynamicEngine is ConstitutiveLaw
      ApplyActionForce2Particle -> NewtonsForceLaw     ApplyActionMomentum2RigidBody -> NewtonsMomentumLaw
      started nice class diagram
      better (but not finished) class diagram
      version used for training with Julien, Frederic, and Luc
      yadeExampleTimeLoop.dia (xml) almost finished
      renaming Action to ActionParameter
      renaming cd...
      renaming cd...
      renamed Action to ActionParameter
      separating gravity to GravityForceFunctor - it is necessery because I'm preparing code for courses.     some filegeneratr examples now have zero gravity, and empty ActionParameterContainer, that is easy to fix with ActionParameterInitializer, when doing ActionParameterInitializer, also ActionParameterReset must be done correctly and split from ActionReset. Then we have to add ActionParameter displacement, position and angularDisplacement, so that ImposeKinematicConditions will work correctly (AngularDisplacementFunctor, DisplacementFunctor (it was Rotor and Translator))
      some cleaning
      stared ActionParameterInitializer and ActionParameterReset
      started LeapFrogOrientationIntegratorFunctor and LeapFrogPositionIntegratorFunctor
      LeapFrogOrientationIntegratorFunctor LeapFrogPositionIntegratorFunctor done
      renaming KinematicMotion to COndition
      renaming KinematicMotion to Condition

      added empty classess:
      added empty FEMSetTextLoaderFunctor
      FEMBeam load the file correctly
      FEM bodies inherit from BodyPhysicalParameters
      scripts to rename classess, hopefully working correctly
      I'm testing the renaming scripts:
      I'm testing the scripts:
      I'm testing the scripts
      scripts should work now, with small human intervention
      I'm testing scripts again
      ./renameClassFilenames FEMTetrahedronParameters FEMTetrahedronData
      ./renameClassDirectories FEMTetrahedronParameters FEMTetrahedronData
      ComplexBody has now actors and initializers, and thanks to that FEMSetTextLoaderFunctor is working.
      FEM is half done - generation works. and other stuff. Only Constitutive Law for FEM is empty - waiting to be written. But there is a compilation problem we have to compile twice now, because of linker errors in fem loader.
      FEM works!!
      GLDrawTetrahedron is now drawing solid tetrahedrons. but sometimes it is drawing not correctly....
      corrected some comments in FEMLaw
      FEM stuff is compiling correctly, some cleaning.

      Much better version of Thread library and multithreaded QGLViewer
      Reenabling GUI updater thread
      Now we use InteractionHashMap by default because InteractionVecSet is not ready yet
      Added RenderingEngines
      Changing build order
      Shadow added but not working yet because of problems with stencil buffer
      Shadows are working but not when they overlap
      Changing stencil function solved the problem with overlapping shadows
      Better lighting parameters
      Faster shadow. Only 1 rendering instead of 3 and use of QUAD_STRIP
      Improved QtGUI
      Improved QtGUI
      some changes in shadows
      Improved SDECSpheresPlanes
      Improved fast shadow volumes
      Added new classes for bounding volume management (not used yet)
      Bounding volume are now both indexalbe and a GeometricalModel
      BoundingVolume update is now done into an actor
      Improved version of GLWindowManager library
      Improved GUI with (de)-serialization of RenderingEngine into SimulationController
      Improved version of QtGUIGenerator. Now boolean are represented by checkboxes instead of linedits
      Better handling of start,stop and reload simulation. Thread now terminate when associated window is closed
      Update in BoundingVolume updating. Now it is working for rootBody through it CollisionGeometrySet. Scene is now dynamically centered when file is loaded
      Changes into FileGenerator
      Fixed some problems with FileGenerators
      Boxes are now casting shadows
      Boxes are now casting shadows
      Better handling of thread into GUI. But they are still problems especially if you close the first GLWindows because it contain the GLContext where the GL lists are stored
      Improved stability
      Threads improvement
      Somes changes into Thread and GUI
      Mush better handling of threads, open/close ... it is never crashing on my laptop at least
      Now yade is no more segfaulting on exit
      Display list are now builded at each new creation of RenderingEngine
      Changes into threads
      Added createDynlib script
      Added Messagedialog
      Fix error when reloading simulation and display list are now not built several times
      Redesigned the way we use boost::lock
      Added mutex into Threadable sleep method
      Added changes from snippets Thread
      Better handling of real simulation duration
      Improved GUI
      Persistent SAPCollider is now working.
      Added PersistantSAPCollider files that were missing in previous revision
      Added script addClassToDynLib
      Fix crash with permanent links.
      Added clas InteractionPhysics     Added subproject InteractionPhysics     Renamed subproject InteractionModel to InterationGeometry
      Added into SVN repository omitted files InteractionPhysics
      Problem with InteractionPhysics
      Corrected kdevelop mistakes due to introduction of InteractionPhysics
      Added SDECContactPhysics and SDECPermanentLinkPhysics
      Fix mistake into SDECPermentLink : Some attributes were not registered
      Implemented InteractionPhysics and InteractionGeometry
      Updated todo list : Switch all possible dynamic_pointer_cast to PointedType * p = static_cast<PointedType*>(shared_p.get())
      Added Action, ActionContainer, SDECLinearContactModel, PhysicalInteractor.     We started redesign to introduce Action which are the response of a DynamicEngine to an     Interaction and acts on body.
      Adding factorable macros into Action and ActionContainer
      Add function add,sub and reset into Action classes.     Almost finished action container.
      You have to call createIndex() from constructor of all Indexable class.     Before adding displatcher for applying Actions.
      Added ActionDispatcher. Now we want to use it.
      Now ActionDispatcher is working.
      Added omitted files from previous commit.
      Added single step button in QtGUI     Better SpheresPlanes FileGenerator
      Started to rename and move SimpleNarrowCollider and classes related to     InteractionPhysics
      InteractionPhysicsDispatcher starts to works. But we have to make BodyPhysics
      HangingCloth is working again but it is designed using Yade framework
      Small changes into MassSpring so that it is faster
      Added BodyPhysics class and moved all type of bodies into subdirectory     BodyPhysics
      To add BodyPhysicalParameter we have to make OpenGLDispatchers. So we started to     add all of them.
      OpenGL continued...
      Stuff with BodyPhysicalParameters is compiling .
      Corrected some bugs due to introduction of BodyPhysicalParameters
      Created TimeIntegratorFunctor and Dispatcher.     BallisticDynamicEngine is now LeapFrogIntegrator
      Corrected KinematicEngine.     MassSpring cloth is now working : but we still have to update geometricalModel
      Added layout and scrollview to QTGUI
      corrected function name into Quaternion
      Added file yade.sxw which contain concept and spirit of yade
      Added tree file to rename files and directories
      Added some concepts into yade.sxw
